# Notebook Automation

A comprehensive toolkit that transforms educational content into intelligent, searchable knowledge bases. It processes PDFs, extracts annotations, generates AI-powered summaries from videos (with transcripts) and questions/answers, creates hierarchical course structures, and seamlessly integrates with popular tools like Obsidian and Anki for enhanced learning workflows.

## üí° The Story Behind this Project

Like many students and lifelong learners, I found myself manually collecting course content from various online platforms‚Äîdownloading PDFs, saving lecture notes, organizing video files, and trying to keep track of assignments across multiple courses. This tedious process consumed hours that could have been spent actually learning.

After spending countless evenings manually organizing course materials, I discovered the brilliant [coursera-dl](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl) and [Coursera-Downloader](https://github.com/touhid314/Coursera-Downloader) projects. These tools opened my eyes to the power of automation for educational content management. The coursera-dl project, with its ability to batch download lecture resources and organize them with meaningful names, and the Coursera-Downloader's intuitive GUI for downloading entire courses, showed me what was possible when automation meets education.

Inspired by these projects but needing broader functionality beyond just downloading, I set out to create a comprehensive toolkit that could not only organize content but also analyze, tag, and enhance it with AI-powered insights. The result is Notebook Automation‚Äîa project born from the frustration of manual organization and the inspiration of seeing what thoughtful automation could achieve in the educational space.

### Obsidian Content Indexes and Class View

#### Navigation Through Indexes

Demonstrate here is the hierarchical navigation system within Obsidian. Using the Bases template system, users can easily explore their course content through structured indexes. These indexes provide a clear overview of programs, courses, modules, and lessons, enabling seamless navigation and quick access to specific sections of the educational material.

![Obsidian Content Indexes for easy navigation](docs/images/Obsidian-Hierarchical-Indexes.png)

#### Class-Level Page Tracking

Highlighting the class-level page view, which tracks individual notes and document statuses. This view allows users to monitor the progress of their course materials, ensuring that all notes and documents are properly organized and up-to-date. It provides a centralized location to manage and review class-specific content efficiently.

### Obsidian Plugin Integration

#### Comprehensive Settings & Configuration

The Obsidian plugin provides a comprehensive settings interface that allows you to customize every aspect of the automation workflow. From enabling specific AI processing features to configuring file paths and behavior options, the settings panel gives you granular control over how the toolkit integrates with your vault and processes your educational content.The Notebook Automation toolkit has been designed for both command-line interface (CLI) and Obsidian plugin usage, providing users with flexible deployment options to match their preferred workflow. Whether you prefer the precision and automation capabilities of CLI commands or the seamless integration within your Obsidian vault, the system offers extensive and flexible configuration options that adapt to your specific needs and preferences.

#### Contextual Menu Integration

The plugin seamlessly integrates with Obsidian's native interface through context menus, providing instant access to powerful automation features directly from your file explorer. Right-click on any folder or file to access processing options like AI summarization, index generation, and OneDrive synchronization‚Äîbringing professional-grade automation tools directly into your daily workflow.

#### OneDrive & Vault Synchronization

The toolkit includes sophisticated synchronization capabilities that bridge your Obsidian vault with OneDrive storage, ensuring your educational content remains accessible across all devices and platforms. The system supports both bidirectional synchronization (default) for seamless two-way updates, and unidirectional synchronization for controlled content flow. This flexible approach allows you to maintain local vault organization while leveraging cloud storage benefits, automatically handling file mapping, conflict resolution, and maintaining metadata consistency between your vault structure and OneDrive folders.
