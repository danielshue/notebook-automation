# Notebook Automation

A powerful C# toolkit for processing and organizing notebooks with AI-powered analysis and automated workflows.

## 💡 The Story Behind This Project

Like many students and lifelong learners, I found myself manually collecting course content from various online platforms—downloading PDFs, saving lecture notes, organizing video files, and trying to keep track of assignments across multiple courses. This tedious process consumed hours that could have been spent actually learning.

After spending countless evenings manually organizing course materials, I discovered the brilliant [coursera-dl](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl) and [Coursera-Downloader](https://github.com/touhid314/Coursera-Downloader) projects. These tools opened my eyes to the power of automation for educational content management. The coursera-dl project, with its ability to batch download lecture resources and organize them with meaningful names, and the Coursera-Downloader's intuitive GUI for downloading entire courses, showed me what was possible when automation meets education.

Inspired by these projects but needing broader functionality beyond just downloading, I set out to create a comprehensive toolkit that could not only organize content but also analyze, tag, and enhance it with AI-powered insights. The result is Notebook Automation—a project born from the frustration of manual organization and the inspiration of seeing what thoughtful automation could achieve in the educational space.
