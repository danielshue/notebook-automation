  "details": "# AppConfigTests NullReferenceException Fix\n\nFixed an issue in the `WithUnderlyingConfiguration_ShouldUseUnderlyingValues` test in `AppConfigTests.cs` that was causing a NullReferenceException.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe test was failing with:\n```\nSystem.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\nat NotebookAutomation.Core.Configuration.AppConfig.LoadConfiguration() in D:\\source\\notebook-automation-csharp-migration\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Core\\Configuration\\AppConfig.cs:line 129\n```\n\nThis was occurring in the `LoadConfiguration()` method of the `AppConfig` class while trying to access sections from the configuration.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe test had a mix of two different configuration approaches:\n1. It was setting up a mock configuration with `_configurationMock` but not using it\n2. It was creating a real `IConfigurationRoot` with `ConfigurationBuilder().AddInMemoryCollection()`\n3. After creating a real configuration, it was overriding properties directly on the AppConfig object\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Removed the mock configuration setup since it wasn't being used\n2. Enhanced the configuration dictionary with all required configuration sections\n3. Removed the manual property overrides and let the AppConfig load values from configuration\n4. Changed the assertions to match the expected properties loaded from configuration\n\nThis ensures the test properly verifies that AppConfig loads configuration values from the underlying IConfiguration correctly.\n\n## Results\n\n- The `WithUnderlyingConfiguration_ShouldUseUnderlyingValues` test now passes\n- All 9 AppConfigTests are passing\n- All 341 tests in the solution are passing (339 succeeded, 2 skipped)",
