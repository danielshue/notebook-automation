  "title": "Content File Module Preservation Fix",
  "details": "# Content File Module Preservation Fix\n\n## Problem Description\nContent files (videos, readings, instructions, etc.) were losing their module field in YAML frontmatter when using the `vault ensure-metadata` command. Specifically:\n- Content files needed to maintain the module field with number-only format (e.g., \"01\")\n- Video files were losing their module field, while instruction files were keeping it\n- The issue was traced to the `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` method, which removed the module field based on template type\n\n## Root Cause\n- The hierarchy management logic in `MetadataHierarchyDetector.cs` determined which fields to include based on templateType\n- Video files with templateType=\"\" had their module field removed due to maxLevel=1\n- Instruction files with templateType=\"resource-instruction\" kept their module field\n\n## Solution\n1. Enhanced `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` method to detect content files based on:\n   - Explicit templateType values like \"resource-video\", \"resource-instruction\", etc.\n   - Metadata field keywords like \"video\", \"reading\", \"instruction\"\n   - Number-only module values like \"01\", \"02\" (strong indicator of a content file)\n\n2. Added special case handling to preserve the module field for content files:\n   - Skip removal of the module field when a content file is detected\n   - Preserve the original module value throughout hierarchy processing\n   - Added checks at critical points to prevent module field removal\n   - Re-add the module field at the end of processing if needed\n\n3. Added comprehensive unit test:\n   - Created `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy_PreservesModuleForContentFiles` test\n   - Tests multiple content file scenarios, including empty templateType\n   - Verifies module field is preserved across all scenarios\n\n## Key Files Modified\n- `MetadataHierarchyDetector.cs`: Updated the `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` method\n- `MetadataHierarchyDetectorTests.cs`: Added new unit test\n\n## Testing\n- All content files now retain their module field with correct number-only format (e.g., \"01\")\n- Existing functionality for non-content files is unchanged\n- All unit tests pass, including the new content file specific test",
