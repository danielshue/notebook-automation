  "details": "ISSUE: Double titles appearing in generated video notes.\n\nROOT CAUSE: The final_summary_prompt.md template at src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Prompts/final_summary_prompt.md contained \"# {{title}}\" which generated a title heading. Even after setting includeNoteTypeTitle: false in VideoNoteProcessor.cs, the AI template was still producing the title heading.\n\nDISCOVERY: There were two different final_summary_prompt.md files:\n1. prompts/final_summary_prompt.md (without # {{title}}) \n2. src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Prompts/final_summary_prompt.md (with # {{title}})\n\nThe executable was using the Core project's version which had the duplicate title.\n\nFLOW THAT CAUSED THE ISSUE:\n1. VideoNoteProcessor.GenerateVideoNoteAsync calls GenerateAiSummaryAsync with final_summary_prompt\n2. AI processes template with # {{title}} and returns content with title heading\n3. Even with includeNoteTypeTitle: false, the AI-generated content already contained the title\n4. Result: Title heading from AI template appeared in final markdown\n\nSOLUTION APPLIED:\n1. Changed includeNoteTypeTitle from true to false in VideoNoteProcessor.cs line 1079 (prevents DocumentNoteProcessorBase from adding title)\n2. Removed \"# {{title}}\" from src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Prompts/final_summary_prompt.md template (prevents AI from generating title heading)\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Tools/VideoProcessing/VideoNoteProcessor.cs (line 1079 - includeNoteTypeTitle: false)\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Prompts/final_summary_prompt.md (removed # {{title}} line)\n\nFINAL STATUS: FIXED - Both sources of duplicate titles eliminated. Executable rebuilt with timestamp 10:08:59 AM on 6/15/2025. Double title issue should now be resolved.",
