  "title": "Vault Index Hierarchy Level Bug Fix - COMPLETED",
  "details": "## Issue Description - RESOLVED\nThe \"vault generate-index\" command incorrectly calculated hierarchy levels when generating indexes for subfolders within the vault. The problem occurred because the code used the target path (e.g., a course folder deep in the hierarchy) as the vault root for hierarchy calculations.\n\n## Root Cause\nIn both `VaultCommands.cs` and `VaultIndexBatchProcessor.cs`, the `CalculateHierarchyLevel` method was called with the target folder path instead of the configured vault root, causing incorrect hierarchy level calculations.\n\n## Resolution - COMPLETED\n**Files Fixed:**\n1. **VaultCommands.cs** - Fixed `CalculateHierarchyLevel` call to use `_appConfig.Paths.NotebookVaultFullpathRoot` \n2. **VaultIndexBatchProcessor.cs** - Updated `CalculateHierarchyLevel` method signature and implementation to correctly use vault root\n3. **MetadataHierarchyDetector.cs** - Fixed field naming conventions (_logger, _notebookVaultRoot, etc.) and replaced remaining Console.WriteLine DEBUG statements\n\n**Code Changes:**\n- Changed hierarchy calculation to always use configured vault root path unless --override-vault-root is specified\n- Fixed path handling to support both absolute and relative paths, with/without leading slashes\n- Migrated Console.WriteLine DEBUG statements to Logger.LogDebug calls where possible\n- Updated field naming to follow C# conventions with _ prefix\n\n**Testing Results:**\n✅ Command works with relative path: \"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\" \n✅ Command works with leading slash: \"/Value Chain Management/Operations Management\"\n✅ Hierarchy levels now correctly calculated (e.g., Operations Management = level 3)\n✅ All subfolders show correct hierarchy levels in debug output\n✅ Build succeeds without errors\n✅ Path validation and error handling work correctly\n\n**Status:** RESOLVED - All functionality working as expected",
