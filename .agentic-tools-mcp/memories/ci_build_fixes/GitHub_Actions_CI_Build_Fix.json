  "details": "## GitHub Actions CI Build Failure Resolution\n\n### Problem\nThe GitHub Actions CI build was failing while local builds succeeded. Analysis revealed the failure was due to static code analysis errors from `dotnet format --verify-no-changes --severity error`.\n\n### Root Cause\n1. **Code Formatting Issues**: Multiple whitespace formatting violations, encoding problems, and import ordering issues detected by dotnet format\n2. **Release Build Configuration Issues**: `SelfContained=true` setting in Release configuration was causing build errors related to RuntimeIdentifier requirements\n\n### Solution Applied\n1. **Fixed Code Formatting**: \n   - Ran `dotnet format src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.sln` to automatically fix all formatting issues\n   - Resolved whitespace, encoding (CHARSET), and import ordering (IMPORTS) violations\n   - Fixed issues in files like LoggingService.cs, ILoggingService.cs, PromptTemplateService.cs, and various test files\n\n2. **Fixed CLI Project Configuration**:\n   - Removed `PublishSingleFile` and `SelfContained` properties from Release configuration \n   - These properties were causing the build system to look for RuntimeIdentifier during regular builds\n   - Publish operations still work correctly when explicitly specifying these properties\n\n### Verification\n- ✅ `dotnet format --verify-no-changes --severity error` now passes cleanly\n- ✅ Release build (`dotnet build --configuration Release`) works successfully\n- ✅ All tests pass in Release configuration (257 passed, 2 skipped)\n- ✅ Publish operations still work with explicit PublishSingleFile/SelfContained settings\n\n### CI Build Impact\nThis fix resolves the CI build failure and ensures that:\n- Static code analysis step will pass\n- Release builds work correctly in CI environment\n- All formatting standards are enforced consistently",
