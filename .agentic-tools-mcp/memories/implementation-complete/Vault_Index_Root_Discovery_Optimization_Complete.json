  "title": "Vault Index Root Discovery Optimization Complete",
  "details": "TASK COMPLETED: Successfully optimized and corrected the logic for discovering and linking to the \"root index\" file in the VaultIndexContentGenerator class.\n\n## Final Implementation:\n\n**GetRootIndexFilename Method:**\n- Implemented caching mechanism using static ConcurrentDictionary to avoid repeated file system lookups\n- Always returns relative path including filename and .md extension\n- Uses DiscoverRootIndexFilename for actual file discovery logic\n\n**DiscoverRootIndexFilename Method - Updated Priority Order:**\n1. **FIRST PRIORITY**: Check for file named after the folder (e.g., MBA/MBA.md)\n2. **SECOND PRIORITY**: Look for standard prioritized filenames (index.md, Index.md, README.md, Home.md, Main.md)\n3. **THIRD PRIORITY**: Search for any .md file with \"template-type: main\" in content\n4. **FINAL DECISION**: Return expected folder-named file (even if it doesn't exist yet) - **ENHANCED**\n\n## Key Features Implemented:\n- ✅ Efficient caching to prevent repeated file system searches\n- ✅ Folder-named index file discovery (primary use case for Obsidian vaults)\n- ✅ **NEW**: Supports initial index creation scenarios by returning expected filename\n- ✅ Comprehensive fallback hierarchy for various vault conventions\n- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting filename discovery issues\n- ✅ Always returns filename with .md extension for proper linking\n- ✅ Directory existence check to prevent errors during file scanning\n- ✅ All tests pass after implementation\n\n## Performance Improvements:\n- Eliminated O(n) file system lookups per GetRootIndexFilename call\n- Reduced from multiple Directory.GetFiles() calls to single cached discovery\n- Added debug logging to trace discovery process without performance penalty\n- Added safety check for directory existence before file scanning\n\n## Enhancement for Initial Index Creation:\nThe method now handles the case where no root index file exists yet (e.g., first-time index creation) by:\n- Determining the **expected** folder-named filename upfront\n- Returning this expected filename even if the file doesn't exist\n- Enabling proper relative path calculation for initial index creation scenarios\n- Maintaining the folder-naming convention as the preferred approach\n\n## User Validation:\n- Build successful: ✅\n- All existing tests pass: ✅\n- Handles both existing and non-existing root index scenarios: ✅\n- Ready for user testing in actual vault environment\n\nThe implementation now correctly prioritizes folder-named index files and supports initial index creation scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility with other index file naming conventions.",
