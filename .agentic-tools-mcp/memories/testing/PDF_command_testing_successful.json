  "details": "I've successfully tested the PDF command implementation with a real-world PDF file from OneDrive. The test was conducted with the file \"C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\OneDrive\\Education\\MBA-Resources\\Value Chain Management\\Operations Management\\Case Studies\\Bergerac Systems - The Challenge of Backward Integration.pdf\".\n\n## Test Results\n- PDF command ran successfully with proper configuration\n- Command processed the file and generated a markdown output\n- The output was saved to the correct location in the vault\n- Force flag worked correctly for overwriting existing files\n- Configuration handling for pdf_extensions worked as expected\n- Integration with AI summarization was successful\n- The output file was correctly formatted with summary sections\n\n## Configuration Details\n- Added pdf_extensions to config.json\n- Default extension of .pdf was correctly used\n- OneDrive paths were properly configured\n- All parameters were correctly passed to the batch processor\n\n## Execution Metrics\n- Processing time was approximately 1 minute for the PDF file\n- PDF text extraction and AI summarization worked correctly\n- Batch processing reporting showed successful completion\n- No errors or warnings were reported during execution\n\nThe PDF command implementation now has full feature parity with the video command implementation and is working as expected in real-world scenarios.",
