  "details": "# Test Coverage Improvement Project - Test Failures Analysis\n\n## STATUS: Build successful, but tests failing\n\n## FAILING TESTS:\n1. VaultIndexBatchProcessorTests: \n   - Constructor validation tests are failing because primary constructor doesn't throw ArgumentNullException\n   - InitializeProcessingQueue test failing due to missing method or filtering logic\n   \n2. VaultIndexProcessorCoverageTests:\n   - Multiple reflection-based tests failing - method not found issues\n   - Template/mock setup issues\n   \n3. TokenProviderTests:\n   - Constructor validation tests failing with TargetInvocationException instead of ArgumentNullException\n   \n4. ProgramCoverageTests:\n   - Exit code tests failing - expecting 1 but getting 0\n   - Config view test failing\n   \n## SOLUTIONS NEEDED:\n1. Fix constructor validation approach for primary constructors\n2. Investigate missing methods in VaultIndexProcessor  \n3. Fix TokenProvider reflection-based test approach\n4. Fix Program test expectations around exit codes\n5. Run coverage analysis after fixes\n\n## TEST COVERAGE PROGRESS:\n- Successfully built solution with new test files\n- Created comprehensive test suites for all target classes\n- Need to fix test logic issues before measuring coverage improvement",
