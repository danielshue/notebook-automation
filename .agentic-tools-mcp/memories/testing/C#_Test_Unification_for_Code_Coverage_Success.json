  "title": "C# Test Unification for Code Coverage Success",
  "details": "Successfully unified C# test projects for NotebookAutomation solution to enable proper code coverage collection.\n\nPROBLEM: Code coverage was only capturing NotebookAutomation.Core assembly, not the CLI assembly, despite running tests from both Core.Tests and Cli.Tests projects. The issue was that coverage was collected per test assembly, and the CLI tests weren't meaningfully exercising CLI code.\n\nSOLUTION: Merged both test projects (Core.Tests and Cli.Tests) into a single unified test assembly (NotebookAutomation.Tests) with subfolders Core/ and Cli/ to organize the tests.\n\nKEY CHANGES:\n1. Created new MSTest project: NotebookAutomation.Tests\n2. Merged all dependencies and references from both old test projects\n3. Copied and organized all test files into Core/ and Cli/ subdirectories\n4. Updated all test namespaces to NotebookAutomation.Tests.Core and NotebookAutomation.Tests.Cli\n5. Updated InternalsVisibleTo attributes in both production assemblies to reference the new test assembly\n6. Removed old test projects from solution\n7. Fixed file access conflicts by using unique temp paths per test (using GUIDs)\n8. Resolved duplicate Parallelize attributes\n\nRESULTS:\n- All 771 tests now pass (768 passed, 3 skipped)\n- Single test assembly enables unified code coverage collection\n- Code coverage report generated successfully\n- No more file access conflicts from parallel test execution\n- Test parallelization properly controlled with Workers=1\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES:\n- MSTest continued to run tests in parallel despite various attempts to disable it\n- Solution was to make all temp file/directory usage unique per test using GUIDs\n- Unique paths pattern: Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"TestVault_{Guid.NewGuid().ToString(\"N\")[..8]}\")\n- Coverage collection now works for both Core and CLI assemblies from single test run",
