  "title": "OneDriveCommands Removal - CLI Cleanup",
  "details": "TASK: Remove OneDriveCommands and related tests from the CLI application, as OneDrive API access will be handled only through the API layer.\n\nCOMPLETED ACTIONS:\n1. **Removed Files**:\n   - d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\Commands\\OneDriveCommands.cs\n   - d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.Tests\\Commands\\OneDriveCommandsTests.cs\n\n2. **Updated Program.cs**:\n   - Removed OneDriveCommands instantiation and registration lines:\n     ```csharp\n     var oneDriveCommands = new OneDriveCommands(loggerFactory.CreateLogger<OneDriveCommands>());\n     oneDriveCommands.Register(rootCommand, configOption, debugOption, verboseOption, dryRunOption);\n     ```\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - ✅ Solution builds successfully with no compilation errors\n   - ✅ All tests pass (600 total: 597 succeeded, 3 skipped, 0 failed)\n   - ✅ Help output no longer shows \"onedrive\" command\n   - ✅ No remaining references to OneDriveCommands in active code\n\nIMPACT:\n- CLI help now shows 6 commands instead of 7 (removed \"onedrive\" command)\n- Application maintains all other functionality\n- OneDrive integration will be handled through API endpoints instead of CLI commands\n- Clean separation of concerns between CLI and API layers\n\nCOMMANDS NOW AVAILABLE IN CLI:\n- tag (Tag management commands)\n- vault (Vault management commands) \n- video-notes (Video notes and metadata commands)\n- pdf-notes (PDF notes and metadata commands)\n- generate-markdown (Generate markdown from HTML, TXT, and EPUB sources)\n- config (Configuration management commands)\n\nThis change aligns with the architectural decision to access OneDrive functionality through the API layer rather than direct CLI commands.",
