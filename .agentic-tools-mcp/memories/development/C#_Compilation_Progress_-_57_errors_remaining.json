  "details": "## C# Compilation Issues Final Status Report\n\n### Progress Achieved: 92 ‚Üí 56 errors (39% reduction)\n\n#### ‚úÖ Successfully Fixed:\n1. **Target-typed new() errors** - Resolved across all test files by replacing `new()` with explicit type declarations\n2. **Missing AppConfig parameters** - Fixed MarkdownNoteBuilder constructor calls to include required AppConfig parameter\n3. **Mock type assignments** - Converted List<object> to proper Mock<T> declarations\n4. **Service collection types** - Fixed ServiceCollection and TestServiceProvider assignments\n5. **Variable scope issues** - Cleaned incorrectly placed class-level variable declarations\n6. **Dictionary nullability** - Updated Dictionary<string, object> to Dictionary<string, object?> for C# 9 compatibility\n\n#### üîß Remaining Issues (56 errors):\n1. **MetadataHierarchyDetectorTests.cs** - Malformed variable declarations and initialization syntax from automated cleaning\n2. **Missing detector instances** - Several test methods need proper MetadataHierarchyDetector instantiation\n3. **Broken .Object usage** - PathsConfig.Object references need correction\n4. **Syntax errors from partial cleaning** - Malformed dictionary initializations and method calls\n\n#### üìä Key Statistics:\n- **Files Processed**: 50+ test files across the solution\n- **Scripts Created**: 6 PowerShell automation scripts\n- **Error Reduction**: 39% (from 92 to 56 errors)\n- **Core Projects**: NotebookAutomation.Core and .Cli build successfully\n- **Test Project**: Still has compilation issues preventing test execution\n\n#### üéØ Recommended Next Steps:\n1. **Manual cleanup of MetadataHierarchyDetectorTests.cs** - Fix malformed syntax from automated scripts\n2. **Add missing detector declarations** - Ensure all test methods have proper variable declarations\n3. **Fix remaining .Object usage** - Correct PathsConfig access patterns\n4. **Final build validation** - Confirm all compilation errors resolved\n5. **Test suite execution** - Run full test suite to validate functionality\n\n#### üìù Files Ready for Manual Review:\n- `MetadataHierarchyDetectorTests.cs` (primary remaining issue)\n- Any files with remaining detector/mockAppConfig declaration issues\n\nThe solution is significantly closer to building successfully, with the main Core and CLI projects compiling without errors. The test suite requires targeted manual fixes to complete the compilation resolution.",
