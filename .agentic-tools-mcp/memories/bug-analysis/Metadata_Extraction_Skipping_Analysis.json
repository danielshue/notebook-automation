  "details": "## Issue Analysis: Files Being Skipped During Module Extraction - RESOLVED\n\n### Problem (RESOLVED)\nAll 247 files with numbered patterns (e.g., \"01_01\", \"02_01\", \"03_01\") were being skipped during `vault ensure-metadata` processing with \"no changes needed\" even though the module extraction logic was correctly identifying modules and lessons.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue was NOT a bug - the system was working correctly. The `HasMetadataChanged` method in `MetadataEnsureProcessor` correctly detected that files already contained the exact metadata that the extraction logic would produce.\n\n### Key Findings\n1. **Module extraction works correctly**: The CourseStructureExtractor successfully extracts module/lesson data from numbered patterns\n2. **Files already have correct metadata**: The existing YAML frontmatter in the files already contains the correct module/lesson values that match the extraction logic\n3. **Efficient operation**: The system avoids unnecessary file modifications when metadata is already correct\n\n### Code Evidence\nThe `HasMetadataChanged` method (lines 371-410) only considers changes when:\n- New fields are added\n- Empty fields get populated \n- Existing non-empty values are different\n\nSince the extracted metadata matched the existing metadata perfectly, no changes were needed.\n\n### Resolution\nThis is the expected behavior - the system is working efficiently by not making redundant changes to files that already have correct metadata. The \"skipped (no changes needed)\" message indicates successful validation that metadata is already properly structured.\n\n### Recommendations for Better Module Ordering\nThe user noted that using the first set of numbers from file patterns could improve module ordering. For files like:\n- `01_01_module-overview.md` \n- `02_01_lesson-basics.md`\n- `03_01_advanced-topics.md`\n\nThe system could extract \"01\", \"02\", \"03\" as module numbers to improve hierarchical organization and sorting.",
