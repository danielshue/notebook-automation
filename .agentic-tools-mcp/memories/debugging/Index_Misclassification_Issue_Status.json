  "details": "## Index Misclassification Issue - CONFIRMED BUG\n\n### Root Cause CONFIRMED\nThe vault index generator is incorrectly classifying \"Operations Management\" as a main-level folder instead of a course-level folder, even when using the correct vault root from config.json.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n1. **Configuration**: \n   - Vault root in config.json: `\"c:/users/danshue.REDMOND/Vault/01_Projects/MBA/\"`\n   - Current directory: `C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA`\n   - Target path: `\"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\"`\n\n2. **Expected Hierarchy**:\n   - Level 0 (main): MBA/ (vault root)\n   - Level 1 (program): Value Chain Management/\n   - Level 2 (course): Operations Management/ ‚Üê Should be \"course\"\n\n3. **Actual Result**:\n   - Template-type: \"main\" (INCORRECT)\n   - Template-description: \"Top-level folder for the entire MBA program\"\n\n### Test Results:\n- **Without --force**: Folders processed: 0, Folders skipped: 100 (no regeneration)\n- **With --force**: Folders processed: 100, Folders skipped: 0 (regenerated all)\n- **Final result**: Still shows `template-type: main` (BUG CONFIRMED)\n\n### Issue Status: \n**CONFIRMED BUG** - The hierarchy detection logic is not working correctly. Despite having the correct vault root configuration and path structure, the generator is treating \"Operations Management\" as the top-level main folder instead of a level-2 course folder.\n\n### Code Investigation Needed:\n1. VaultIndexProcessor hierarchy level calculation\n2. MetadataHierarchyDetector implementation\n3. How the relative path is being resolved against the vault root\n4. Path normalization and comparison logic",
