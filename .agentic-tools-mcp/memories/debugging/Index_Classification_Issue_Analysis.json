  "details": "ISSUE: VaultIndexProcessor misclassifies \"Operations Management\" as \"main\" instead of \"course\"\n\nPROBLEM IDENTIFIED:\n- User path: \"c:/users/danshue.REDMOND/Vault/01_Projects/MBA/Value Chain Management/Operations Management\"\n- Expected: \"Operations Management\" should be classified as \"course\" (Level 3 in VaultIndexProcessor)\n- Actual: Being classified as \"main\" (Level 1)\n\nROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:\nThe issue is vault root context, not the hierarchy calculation logic itself. The VaultIndexProcessor correctly calculates hierarchy levels relative to the vault root, but the vault root context needs to be set properly.\n\nVaultIndexProcessor hierarchy (confirmed working correctly):\n- Level 1: \"main\" (vault root)\n- Level 2: \"program\" \n- Level 3: \"course\" ✅\n- Level 4: \"class\"\n- Level 5+: \"module\"\n\nTESTING RESULTS:\n✅ When vault root = \"TestVault\":\n- \"TestVault\" = Level 1 (main)\n- \"Value Chain Management\" = Level 2 (program)  \n- \"Operations Management\" = Level 3 (course) ✅\n\n❌ When vault root = \"TestVault/Value Chain Management/Operations Management\" (with --override-vault-root):\n- \"Operations Management\" = Level 1 (main) ❌\n\nSOLUTION OPTIONS FOR USER:\n1. Use relative path from configured vault root: \"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\"\n2. Update config file to have correct vault root: \"c:/users/danshue.REDMOND/Vault/01_Projects/MBA/\"\n3. Don't use --override-vault-root unless the path should actually be the vault root\n\nSTATUS: RESOLVED - User needs correct vault root context, not code changes.",
