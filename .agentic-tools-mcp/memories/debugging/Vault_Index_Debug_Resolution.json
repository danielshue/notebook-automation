  "details": "VAULT INDEX DEBUGGING - FINAL RESOLUTION\n\n## Root Cause: \nThe issue was NOT with the hierarchy level calculation logic, but with two specific problems:\n1. A mismatch between hierarchy level calculation and template-type mapping (off by one)\n2. Incorrect handling of relative vs absolute paths in CalculateHierarchyLevel\n\n## Problem Details:\n- When running from vault root \"MBA\" with relative path \"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\", the folder was incorrectly classified as \"main\" instead of \"course\"\n- The CalculateHierarchyLevel method was using inconsistent path handling for relative paths\n- Debug output showed the calculation was working correctly, but template-type mapping was incorrect\n\n## Solution Applied:\n1. Fixed CalculateHierarchyLevel method to properly handle relative paths by combining them with vault root\n2. Used full paths for both vault and folder when calculating relative paths\n3. Replaced Console.WriteLine debug output with Logger.LogDebug calls\n4. Fixed corrupted method signature from previous edits\n\n## Key Changes in CalculateHierarchyLevel:\n- Added proper handling for relative paths: `Path.Combine(vaultPath, folderPath)` when path is not rooted\n- Use full paths for calculation: `Path.GetRelativePath(fullVaultPath, fullFolderPath)`\n- Added comprehensive debug logging with Logger.LogDebug\n- Ensured consistent path handling throughout the method\n\n## Testing Required:\n- Run generate-index from vault root \"MBA\" with relative path \"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\"\n- Verify that hierarchy level 2 maps to template-type \"course\" \n- Check debug logs to confirm path resolution is working correctly\n- Ensure output file has correct template-type metadata\n\n## Expected Behavior:\n- Vault root \"MBA\" = level 0\n- \"Value Chain Management\" = level 1 (program)\n- \"Operations Management\" = level 2 (course)\n- Template-type mapping should correctly assign \"course\" for level 2\n\nThe fix ensures that relative folder paths are properly resolved against the vault root before calculating hierarchy levels.",
