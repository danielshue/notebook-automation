  "details": "## Vault Index Debugging - Path Issue Resolution\n\n### Root Cause Found:\nThe path misclassification issue was due to Windows path handling where `Path.IsPathRooted(\"/Operations Management\")` returns `true` because paths starting with \"/\" are considered rooted on Windows.\n\n### Configuration Context:\n- Vault root in config.json: `\"c:/users/danshue.REDMOND/Vault/01_Projects/MBA/\"`\n- This means the system expects paths relative to this subdirectory, not the full vault\n\n### Solution Implemented:\n1. **Fixed CalculateHierarchyLevel method**: Updated to handle leading slashes by normalizing them as relative paths\n2. **Path normalization**: Added logic to remove leading slashes and treat them as relative to vault root\n3. **Improved debug logging**: All Console.WriteLine replaced with proper Logger.LogDebug calls\n4. **Cross-platform case sensitivity**: Added platform-appropriate path comparison using `OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` to choose between case-sensitive (Linux) and case-insensitive (Windows) string comparisons\n5. **Enhanced path validation**: Added check to ensure folder path is actually within vault root before calculating hierarchy\n\n### Key Code Changes:\n- Added normalization step: `normalizedFolderPath = folderPath.TrimStart('/', '\\\\')`\n- Updated rooted path check to exclude already-normalized paths with leading slashes\n- Platform-appropriate comparison: `StringComparison pathComparison = OperatingSystem.IsWindows() ? StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase : StringComparison.Ordinal`\n- Path validation: Check if `relativePath.StartsWith(\"..\")` to detect paths outside vault root\n- Enhanced debug logging for better traceability\n\n### Testing Strategy:\n- Path: \"Value Chain Management/Operations Management\" (relative to configured vault root)\n- Expected hierarchy level: 2 (course level)\n- Expected template-type: \"course\"\n- Cross-platform compatibility for case-sensitive filesystems\n\n### Fixed Files:\n- VaultIndexBatchProcessor.cs - CalculateHierarchyLevel method",
