  "details": "Adding OpenTelemetry tracing and logging to help debug the \"function identifier is empty\" error in Semantic Kernel.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:\n1. ✅ Added OpenTelemetry packages to NotebookAutomation.Core.csproj (1.10.0)\n2. ✅ Created NotebookAutomationTelemetry.cs helper class with ActivitySource\n3. ✅ Enhanced ServiceRegistration.cs to register OpenTelemetry with:\n   - Console exporter for immediate visibility\n   - ActivitySource for SK operations (\"Microsoft.SemanticKernel*\")\n   - Custom traces for function creation (\"NotebookAutomation.Core\")\n   - HTTP instrumentation for AI provider calls\n4. ✅ Enhanced AISummarizer.cs with tracing around:\n   - Function creation (StartSemanticKernelOperation)\n   - Function invocation with activity tags\n   - Error tracking and success metrics\n   - Added main activity trace in SummarizeWithVariablesAsync\n5. ✅ Fixed package version conflicts (updated Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration* to 9.0.0)\n6. ✅ Build succeeded - all compilation errors resolved\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\n- OpenTelemetry integration is configured and compiling successfully\n- Console exporter is set up but traces aren't appearing in test output\n- Need to test with real AI service calls to trigger actual function creation\n- Mock tests don't reproduce the \"function identifier is empty\" error\n\nNEXT STEPS TO DEBUG:\n1. Test with real AI service integration (not mocked)\n2. Run CLI command that triggers actual summarization\n3. Add environment variable to enable OpenTelemetry console output\n4. Verify ActivitySource listeners are properly configured\n5. Test with a simple prompt template to isolate function creation error\n\nKEY INSIGHT FROM MICROSOFT DOCS:\n- Semantic Kernel prompt template syntax uses {{$variableName}} format\n- Our templates appear syntactically correct\n- Error might be in function creation process, not template syntax\n\nDEBUGGING APPROACH:\n- Focus on real integration tests vs unit tests with mocks\n- Use CLI tool with debug mode to trigger real SK function creation\n- Monitor for \"function identifier is empty\" error with detailed traces",
