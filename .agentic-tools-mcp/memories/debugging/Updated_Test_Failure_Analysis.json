  "title": "Updated Test Failure Analysis",
  "details": "## Updated Test Analysis (June 10, 2025)\n\n### PROGRESS MADE:\n- Fixed reflection calls in CourseStructureExtractorTests.cs \n- Fixed syntax errors and nullable reference issues\n- Simplified IsCaseStudyUnderModule logic to not require VaultRoot\n- Fixed MetadataEnsureProcessor to return \"note/instruction\" instead of \"resource-instruction\"\n\n### CURRENT STATUS: \n17 failing tests (down from original 9)\n\n### REMAINING ISSUES:\n\n#### 1. Leading Zero Removal Logic Problem\n**Issue**: Applied leading zero removal too broadly - some tests expect \"01\", others expect \"3\"\n\n**Pattern Analysis**:\n- Case study tests expect leading zeros REMOVED: \"03_module-fundamentals\" -> \"3\" \n- Other content file tests expect leading zeros PRESERVED: \"01_module-intro\" -> \"01\"\n\n**Root Cause**: Need to understand the INTENDED behavior - when should leading zeros be removed vs preserved?\n\n#### 2. Case Study at Class Level Still Failing\n- Path: `D:\\vault\\TestProgram\\TestCourse\\Case Studies\\strategic-planning-case-study.md`\n- Should NOT extract module (class level case study)\n- Still extracting module when it shouldn't\n\n#### 3. Metadata Type Assignment Still Failing\n- DetermineTemplateType still not returning \"note/instruction\"\n- Tests still failing despite the fix\n\n### NEED TO INVESTIGATE:\n1. What's the correct rule for leading zeros in module numbers?\n2. Why is the case study class-level detection still not working?\n3. Why is the metadata type fix not working?\n\n### TEST PATTERN HYPOTHESIS:\n- Content files in numbered module directories should preserve leading zeros for directory-based extraction\n- Case studies under modules should remove leading zeros \n- This suggests different rules for different extraction scenarios",
