  "details": "User reported that lesson index pages in Obsidian vault are not showing expected content fields (Videos, Readings, etc.) in the body after implementing AddLessonLevelContent method. Vault root is at C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA\\. Code changes were made to VaultIndexContentGenerator.cs to prioritize content over navigation for lesson-level folders (hierarchyLevel >= 6), but the generated output is not displaying as expected in Obsidian.",
