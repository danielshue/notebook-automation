  "title": "Vault Index Missing Lesson Content Debug",
  "details": "Issue with vault generate-index CLI tool - lesson content not appearing in generated index files.\n\nProblem: The index file for \"05_application-of-ipo\" lesson folder is being generated with frontmatter and navigation, but missing the actual content section that should list the video file \"05_01_application-of-ipo-video.md\".\n\nInvestigation findings:\n1. The lesson folder contains: \"05_01_application-of-ipo-video.md\" and \"05_application-of-ipo.md\" (index)\n2. The video file has frontmatter but no template-type field\n3. Content categorization should fall back to CategorizeByFilename method\n4. Filename contains \"video\" so should be categorized as \"video\" type\n5. AddLessonLevelContent method should add content by type with [\"video\", \"reading\", \"transcript\", \"assignment\", \"discussion\", \"note\"]\n\nProgress:\n- Added debug logging to VaultIndexProcessor.ScanFolderContentAsync to track file scanning\n- Added debug logging to VaultIndexContentGenerator.AddLessonLevelContent to track content generation\n- Fixed null reference warnings in AddContentByType method by adding proper null checks\n- Build now succeeds without warnings\n\nNext steps: Test the CLI tool with debug output to see if files are being properly detected and categorized.",
