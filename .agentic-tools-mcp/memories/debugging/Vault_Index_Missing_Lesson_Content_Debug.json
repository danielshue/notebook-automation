  "title": "Vault Index Missing Lesson Content Debug",
  "details": "RESOLVED: Issue with vault generate-index CLI tool - lesson content not appearing in generated index files.\n\nProblem: The index file for \"05_application-of-ipo\" lesson folder was being generated with frontmatter and navigation, but missing the actual content section that should list the video file \"05_01_application-of-ipo-video.md\".\n\nROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The video file had `template-type: video-reference` in its frontmatter, but the AddLessonLevelContent method was only looking for content types [\"video\", \"reading\", \"transcript\", \"assignment\", \"discussion\", \"note\"] - it was missing \"video-reference\".\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. Updated AddLessonLevelContent method to include \"video-reference\" in the content types array\n2. Updated GetContentTypeIcon method to handle \"video-reference\" â†’ \"ðŸŽ¥\" \n3. Updated GetContentTypeTitle method to handle \"video-reference\" â†’ \"Videos\"\n4. Added debug logging to VaultIndexProcessor.ScanFolderContentAsync to trace file detection and categorization\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- CLI tool now successfully processes 546 lesson folders\n- Generated index file for \"05_application-of-ipo\" now includes:\n  ## ðŸŽ¥ Videos\n  - [[Application Ipo]]\n\nThe fix ensures that video files with template-type \"video-reference\" are properly categorized and displayed in lesson-level index files.",
