  "details": "## PDF Image Extraction Enhancement - COMPLETED\n\n### Issues Resolved:\n1. **Blank Images**: Using `image.RawBytes` contained raw compressed data, not valid image files - ✅ FIXED\n2. **Missing Image References**: Not all images were being processed due to exceptions/empty arrays - ✅ FIXED\n3. **Image Format Detection**: Defaulting all images to .jpg regardless of actual format - ✅ FIXED\n4. **Missing Text File**: Extracted text with image references wasn't saved next to PDF - ✅ FIXED\n\n### Implementation Details:\n- **Image Extraction**: Now uses `image.TryGetPng()` for reliable PNG extraction\n- **Image Validation**: Only images >100 bytes are saved and referenced\n- **Image References**: Markdown format `[ImageName](filename.png)` inserted inline with text\n- **Text File Output**: Extracted text with image references saved as `{pdf_filename}_extracted_text.txt`\n- **Directory Structure**: Images saved to `{pdf_filename}_images/` folder next to PDF\n- **Error Handling**: Robust validation prevents blank images and failed references\n\n### File Locations:\n- **Images**: `{pdf_path}/{pdf_filename}_images/page_XXX_image_XX.png`\n- **Extracted Text**: `{pdf_path}/{pdf_filename}_extracted_text.txt`\n- **Final Output**: CLI saves markdown to vault directory as configured\n\n### Status: ✅ COMPLETE\nAll requirements met:\n- Images extracted and saved in structured directory\n- Text contains inline image references in markdown format\n- Images interleaved with text in natural reading order\n- Extracted text file saved next to PDF for AI processing\n- Metadata updated with image count and text file path",
