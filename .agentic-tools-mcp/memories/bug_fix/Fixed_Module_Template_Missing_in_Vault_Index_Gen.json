  "title": "Fixed Module Template Missing in Vault Index Gen",
  "details": "ISSUE RESOLVED: The \"vault generate-index\" command was failing to generate indices for many folders because the \"module\" template was missing from the template manager.\n\nROOT CAUSE: The TemplateManager was only loading templates from embedded resources but not from the file system templates directory, causing the \"module\" template (which existed as a file) to be unavailable.\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. Modified TemplateManager.LoadTemplates() method in TemplateManager.cs to load templates from both embedded resources AND file system\n2. Added file system template loading logic that scans the templates directory for .yaml files\n3. Updated the template loading to merge both sources, with file system templates taking precedence over embedded ones\n\nKEY CHANGES:\n- Enhanced LoadTemplates() method to use GetTemplatesFromFileSystem() and GetTemplatesFromEmbeddedResources()\n- File system templates are loaded first, then embedded resources are added if not already present\n- This ensures all available templates (both embedded and file-based) are accessible\n\nRESULT:\n- Command now successfully processes 104 folders instead of mostly skipping them\n- \"module\" template is now found and applied correctly for hierarchy levels 5 and 6\n- Zero failures in the vault index generation process\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing embedded templates\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Services/TemplateManager.cs\n\nThis fix ensures that the template system works with both embedded resources (for built-in templates) and file system templates (for custom templates like \"module\").",
