  "details": "## GitHub Actions Authentication Issue - Root Cause & Solution\n\n### Problem Identified\nGitHub Actions workflow failing with \"Repository not found\" error at checkout step, despite having correct permissions and token configuration.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n**Account Mismatch Issue:**\n- Repository owner: `danielshue` (personal GitHub account)\n- Git committer: `danshue_microsoft` (Microsoft GitHub account, ID: 120842535)\n- Email: `danshue+microsoft@microsoft.com`\n\nThe GitHub Actions runner was trying to authenticate with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` but encountering confusion due to the account mismatch between repository ownership and commit authorship.\n\n### Technical Details\n- Private repository: `danielshue/notebook-automation`\n- All recent commits authored by `danshue_microsoft` account\n- GitHub Actions trying to access private repo without explicit collaborator permissions\n- Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited scope when account context is ambiguous\n\n### Solution: Add Collaborator Access\n\n**Recommended Steps:**\n1. Navigate to: https://github.com/danielshue/notebook-automation/settings/access\n2. Click \"Add people\"\n3. Add username: `danshue_microsoft`\n4. Grant \"Write\" permission level (sufficient for CI/CD operations)\n5. Send invitation and accept it\n\n**Alternative: Admin Permission**\n- Grant \"Admin\" access if full repository management is needed\n- Provides complete access including settings, webhooks, etc.\n\n### Expected Outcome\nOnce `danshue_microsoft` is added as a collaborator:\n- ✅ GitHub Actions authentication will resolve automatically\n- ✅ \"Repository not found\" error will disappear\n- ✅ No additional token configuration needed\n- ✅ Future commits and CI runs will work seamlessly\n- ✅ Can simplify workflow back to basic checkout configuration\n\n### Benefits of This Approach\n1. **Clean Solution**: Addresses root cause rather than symptoms\n2. **No Token Complexity**: Eliminates need for PAT or complex authentication\n3. **Future-Proof**: Works for all future operations from Microsoft account\n4. **Standard Practice**: Normal GitHub collaboration workflow\n5. **Security**: Maintains proper access control through collaborator permissions\n\n### Files That Can Be Simplified\nAfter adding collaborator access, the workflow can use simple checkout:\n```yaml\n- name: Checkout repository\n  uses: actions/checkout@v4\n```\n\nNo explicit token or complex permission configuration required.\n\n### Status\n- Root cause identified: Account mismatch between repo owner and committer\n- Solution documented: Add `danshue_microsoft` as repository collaborator\n- Ready for implementation via GitHub web interface\n- This should resolve all GitHub Actions authentication issues",
