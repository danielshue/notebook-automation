  "details": "GITHUB ACTIONS CI BUILD FAILURE FIX\n\nISSUE IDENTIFIED:\nThe GitHub Actions CI build was failing due to an incorrect path in the local CI build script that mirrors the CI pipeline.\n\nSPECIFIC PROBLEM:\nIn scripts/build-ci-local.ps1, line 203 had:\n$cliProjectPath = Join-Path $ScriptDir \"src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\"\n\nThis was using $ScriptDir (which points to the 'scripts' directory) instead of $RepositoryRoot, causing the path to resolve to:\nscripts/src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Cli/NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\n\nThe correct path should be:\nd:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\n\nFIX APPLIED:\nChanged line 203 to:\n$cliProjectPath = Join-Path $RepositoryRoot \"src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\"\n\nROOT CAUSE:\nThis bug was likely introduced during the recent repository restructuring when config files were moved to config/ and build scripts were moved to scripts/. The local build script wasn't updated to account for the new location.\n\nTESTING:\n- Local CI build now passes completely including all publish operations\n- Binary generation successful for both win-x64 and win-arm64\n- Static code analysis passes\n- All build steps mirror the GitHub Actions CI pipeline successfully\n\nGITHUB ACTIONS IMPACT:\nSince the GitHub Actions workflow uses the correct absolute paths in the YAML file, this specific bug only affected the local development mirror script. However, the local script failure indicated potential path issues that could affect CI.\n\nSTATUS: FIXED and VERIFIED",
