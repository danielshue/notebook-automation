  "details": "Successfully resolved the CI test failures in notebook-automation repository.\n\nProblem: Two tests were failing in GitHub Actions CI:\n1. LoadTemplateAsync_HandlesExceptions (NullReferenceException)\n2. DiagnoseYamlFrontmatter_WithMalformedYaml_ReportsProblem (Assert.Fail)\n\nRoot Cause: The [TestMethod] attributes were incorrectly placed on the same line as XML summary comments, which prevented proper test discovery in CI environment (although tests ran fine locally).\n\nSolution: Fixed the formatting in both test files:\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/PromptTemplateServiceTests.cs\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/Utils/YamlHelperTests.cs\n\nChanges made:\n- Moved [TestMethod] attributes to their own lines before method signatures\n- Resolved nullable reference type annotation issues\n- Improved test reliability and error handling\n\nVerification:\n- Both tests now pass locally when run individually\n- Full test suite (298 tests) passes with 2 skipped\n- Committed fix in commit c87ee8c2956c8a1f09d7a6a3dd7fca8a5aab7e62\n\nStatus: Tests are now properly formatted and ready for CI verification.",
