  "details": "FIXED: Test Method Attribute Formatting Issues in CI\n\n**Problem:**\nTwo tests were failing in GitHub Actions CI but passing locally:\n- LoadTemplateAsync_HandlesExceptions (in PromptTemplateServiceTests.cs)\n- DiagnoseYamlFrontmatter_WithMalformedYaml_ReportsProblem (in YamlHelperTests.cs)\n\n**Root Cause:**\nBoth test methods had formatting issues where the [TestMethod] attribute was incorrectly placed on the same line as the XML documentation summary comment, like this:\n```csharp\n/// </summary>    [TestMethod]\npublic async Task LoadTemplateAsync_HandlesExceptions()\n```\n\nThis caused the test discovery to fail, so the tests weren't being recognized by the test runner.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Fixed the formatting by separating the [TestMethod] attribute onto its own line:\n```csharp\n/// </summary>\n[TestMethod]\npublic async Task LoadTemplateAsync_HandlesExceptions()\n```\n\n2. Removed nullable reference type annotations (string? to string) to avoid compilation warnings without nullable context.\n\n**Results:**\n- Both tests now pass locally (confirmed with individual and combined test runs)\n- Full test suite shows 298 tests pass, 2 skipped (out of 300 total)\n- Tests are now properly discovered by the test runner\n- Changes committed and pushed to trigger CI validation\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/PromptTemplateServiceTests.cs\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/Utils/YamlHelperTests.cs\n\n**Commit:** c87ee8c - \"fix(tests): Fix test method attribute formatting issues\"\n\n**Next Step:** Monitor the CI workflow to confirm tests now pass in the GitHub Actions environment as well.",
