  "details": "FINAL STATUS SUMMARY: Major progress made in resolving C# 13/.NET 9 compilation issues.\n\nPROGRESS ACHIEVED:\n✅ Reduced compilation errors from 222 to approximately 60-80 remaining errors\n✅ Fixed most target-typed new() issues across the test suite\n✅ Corrected AppConfig mock declarations in most files\n✅ Fixed MarkdownNoteBuilder constructor calls with missing AppConfig parameters\n✅ Resolved syntax errors in MetadataHierarchyDetectorPathTests.cs\n✅ Created automated scripts that successfully processed 110 test files\n\nREMAINING ISSUES TO ADDRESS:\n1. **Missing mockAppConfig declarations**: Several test files still reference mockAppConfig.Object without declaring the variable\n2. **List<object> vs List<string> type mismatches**: Some collections still incorrectly typed as List<object> when they should be List<string>\n3. **Complex collection types**: Dictionary<string, object> and similar types need proper specification\n4. **VaultIndexContentGeneratorTests.cs**: Multiple type conversion errors and missing variables\n5. **Method parameter mismatches**: Some method calls have incorrect parameter types due to List<object> vs proper types\n\nCRITICAL FILES NEEDING ATTENTION:\n- VaultIndexContentGeneratorTests.cs (many collection type errors)\n- Various *ProcessorTests.cs files (missing mockAppConfig)\n- AppConfigTests.cs and related configuration test files\n\nAUTOMATION SCRIPTS CREATED:\n- fix-target-typed-new.ps1 (successful, fixed 38 files)\n- fix-incorrect-list-object.ps1 (successful, fixed 19 files) \n- fix-final-compilation-issues.ps1 (partial success, had regex issue)\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Add missing mockAppConfig declarations to files that reference mockAppConfig.Object\n2. Fix remaining collection type specifications (List<string>, Dictionary<string, object>, etc.)\n3. Address VaultIndexContentGeneratorTests.cs specifically\n4. Run final build to confirm all issues resolved\n5. Execute test suite to ensure functionality\n\nThe solution is in much better shape - from ~222 errors down to ~60-80 errors. The remaining issues are more straightforward type fixes and missing variable declarations.",
