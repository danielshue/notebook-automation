  "title": "VideoNoteProcessor YAML frontmatter issue",
  "details": "The VideoNoteProcessor was missing the \"yamlfrontmatter\" variable in its prompt variables, causing errors when the AI summarizer expected this variable. \n\nISSUE DISCOVERED: The AISummarizer expects the variable name \"yamlfrontmatter\" (without dash), but both PdfNoteProcessor and VideoNoteProcessor were providing \"yaml-frontmatter\" (with dash). Fixed both processors to use the correct variable name \"yamlfrontmatter\".\n\nCURRENT STATUS: Updated both processors to use \"yamlfrontmatter\" variable name. Build is successful but still seeing the variable not found error during runtime. Need to investigate the call flow to ensure the GenerateAiSummaryAsync override is being called properly in the video processor.",
