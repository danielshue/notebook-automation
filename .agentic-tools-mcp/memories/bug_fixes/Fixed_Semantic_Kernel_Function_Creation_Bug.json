  "title": "Fixed Semantic Kernel Function Creation Bug",
  "details": "COMPLETED: Semantic Kernel \"Function Identifier is Empty\" Bug Fix in AISummarizer\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED:\n- The video-notes command was failing to generate AI summaries due to a Semantic Kernel error: \"The function identifier is empty\"\n- Root cause was template variable mismatch in prompt templates (using {{$content}} instead of {{$input}})\n\nCHANGES IMPLEMENTED:\n\n1. Enhanced AISummarizer.cs with robust error handling:\n   - Added detailed logging around Semantic Kernel function creation\n   - Implemented variable substitution logic that replaces {{$content}} with {{$input}} before function creation\n   - Added fallback mechanism when function creation fails\n   - Changed SummarizeWithChunkingAsync from protected to internal for testability\n\n2. Clean-up of using statements:\n   - Moved common using statements to GlobalUsings.cs in both CLI and test projects\n   - Removed redundant using statements from all relevant files\n   - Maintained clean, organized imports across the codebase\n\n3. Created comprehensive unit tests:\n   - AISummarizerSemanticKernelTests.cs tests variable substitution and fallback logic\n   - Tests verify proper handling of null kernel scenarios\n   - Tests confirm chunking flow is triggered for large text inputs\n   - All tests pass and verify the fix works correctly\n\n4. Fixed test compatibility issues:\n   - Updated TestableAISummarizerForProtected.cs to use correct access modifiers\n   - Resolved compilation errors in test doubles\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- All 651 tests in the solution pass\n- Build succeeds with only 1 minor warning about deprecated method\n- New tests specifically validate the Semantic Kernel fixes\n- Integration tests confirm proper fallback behavior\n\nThe fix ensures that when prompt templates contain variables like {{$onedrivePath}} and {{$course}}, they are properly substituted before creating Semantic Kernel functions, preventing the \"function identifier is empty\" error that was blocking AI summary generation.",
