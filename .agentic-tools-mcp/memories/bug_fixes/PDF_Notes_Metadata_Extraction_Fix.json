  "title": "PDF Notes Metadata Extraction Fix",
  "details": "Fixed critical metadata extraction issues in PDF note processing:\n\n**Problem**: PDF notes generated with `na pdf-notes` were missing metadata fields (course, class, onedrive-shared-link, page-count) despite being detected in logs.\n\n**Root Cause**: \n1. `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` was called without the correct template type, causing only program field to be set (maxLevel=1)\n2. Duplicate page count fields (`page_count` vs `page-count`) \n3. Missing OneDrive shared link generation\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Fixed `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` call in `PdfNoteProcessor.cs` to pass `\"pdf-reference\"` as template type\n2. Standardized page count field to `page-count` throughout codebase\n3. Added async logic to generate OneDrive shared link after PDF extraction\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Tools/PdfProcessing/PdfNoteProcessor.cs`\n\n**Unit Test Coverage**:\n- **Added new test file**: `PdfNoteProcessorMetadataTests.cs` with 2 test methods\n- Tests verify that `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` with `pdf-reference` template includes all hierarchy levels (program, course, class)\n- Tests demonstrate the bug scenario (calling without template type) vs fixed scenario\n- Tests are integration-style, using real `MetadataHierarchyDetector` to test actual logic\n\n**Verification**:\n- All 597 unit tests pass (0 failed, 594 succeeded, 3 skipped) - NEW TESTS INCLUDED\n- Manual testing shows correct metadata fields in generated markdown output\n- Course, class, page-count, and onedrive-shared-link now properly populated in YAML frontmatter",
