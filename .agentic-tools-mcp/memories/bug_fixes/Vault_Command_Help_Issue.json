  "title": "Vault Command Help Issue",
  "details": "**Issue**: The `na.exe vault` and `na.exe vault --help` commands did not display subcommand help because the `vaultCommand` and its subcommands lacked handlers to display help information.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `VaultCommands.cs`, the `vaultCommand` was created and subcommands were added to it, but unlike `TagCommands.cs`, there was no `SetHandler` method called on the parent `vaultCommand` to handle cases where no subcommand is specified. Additionally, the individual subcommands (`ensure-metadata` and `clean-index`) did not have help handlers when required arguments were missing.\n\n**Solution**: Added help handlers for all vault commands:\n1. **Parent `vaultCommand`**: Added `SetHandler` to display available subcommands and their descriptions when no subcommand is specified\n2. **`generateIndexCommand`**: Already had help handler (was working correctly)\n3. **`ensureMetadataCommand`**: Added help handler to check for required path argument and display usage information\n4. **`cleanIndexCommand`**: Added help handler to check for required path argument and display comprehensive usage information\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n- Uses `AnsiConsoleHelper.WriteUsage` to display formatted help consistently\n- Each subcommand checks for required path argument using `GetValueForArgument(pathArg)`\n- Shows detailed usage information including all available options\n- Parent command lists all subcommands with descriptions\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\Commands\\VaultCommands.cs`\n\n**Testing Results**:\n- `na.exe vault` ✅ Shows subcommand list\n- `na.exe vault generate-index` ✅ Shows detailed usage\n- `na.exe vault ensure-metadata` ✅ Shows detailed usage  \n- `na.exe vault clean-index` ✅ Shows detailed usage\n\n**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All vault commands now display appropriate help information",
