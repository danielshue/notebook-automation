  "details": "RESOLVED: Metadata Update Issue for Moved Case Studies\n\nPROBLEM: Case studies that were moved from the original \"business-strategy-operations-course\" directory to \"operations-management-quality-and-supply-chain\" were not getting their metadata updated when running vault ensure-metadata. Specifically, outdated `class`, `course`, and `module` fields were still present.\n\nSOLUTION: The issue required running the metadata update command twice with different scopes:\n\n1. First run on the broader directory updated most files but left the Case Studies with outdated metadata due to vault root context\n2. Second run specifically on the Case Studies directory with proper vault root override removed the outdated fields\n\nCOMMANDS USED:\n```\n# First: Update the entire directory structure\ndotnet run -- vault ensure-metadata \"C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA\\Value Chain Management\\Operations Management\\operations-management-quality-and-supply-chain\" --config \"D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\config\\config.json\" --override-vault-root --verbose\n\n# Second: Clean up the Case Studies specifically  \ndotnet run -- vault ensure-metadata \"C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA\\Value Chain Management\\Operations Management\\operations-management-quality-and-supply-chain\\Case Studies\" --config \"D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\config\\config.json\" --override-vault-root --verbose\n```\n\nRESULTS:\n- Successfully processed 62 files in first run, 7 files in second run\n- All moved case studies now have properly cleaned metadata:\n  * Removed outdated `course: 'Operations Management'`\n  * Removed outdated `class: 'operations-management-quality-and-supply-chain'`\n  * Removed outdated `module: 'Case Studies'`\n  * Kept proper `program: 'Value Chain Management'`\n  * Updated `date-modified` to 2025-06-10\n  * Maintained appropriate tags for categorization\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Checked multiple case studies after both updates\n- Confirmed no residual hierarchy fields remain\n- Confirmed proper permalink generation for new location\n- All case studies now have clean, contextually appropriate metadata\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n- Sometimes metadata updates require multiple passes with different vault root contexts\n- The `--override-vault-root` flag behavior depends on the directory being processed\n- Case Studies moved between course structures may need targeted cleanup\n- Always verify the actual file metadata after dry-run shows expected changes",
