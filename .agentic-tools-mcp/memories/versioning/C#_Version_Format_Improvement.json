  "details": "# C# Version Format Improvement\n\n## Overview\nEnhanced the versioning scheme for the Notebook Automation project to comply with Microsoft's recommended format for assembly versions and fixed the handling of assembly paths in single-file applications.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Version Format\n- Changed from timestamp-based format (`1.0.0.yyMMdd.HHmm`) to Microsoft's recommended format (`major.minor.build.revision`)\n- Implemented a standardized calculation:\n  - Major: 1 (fixed)\n  - Minor: 0 (fixed)\n  - Build: Days since Jan 1, 2024\n  - Revision: Seconds since midnight / 2 (for local builds) or GitHub run number (for CI builds)\n\n### Single-File App Compatibility\n- Replaced usage of `Assembly.Location` with `Environment.ProcessPath` and `AppContext.BaseDirectory`\n- Implemented a more robust strategy for determining assembly paths, especially in single-file apps\n- Added proper fallbacks for error cases\n\n### Build Scripts\n- Updated both local build script and GitHub Actions workflow for consistent versioning\n- Made version strings match the recommended Microsoft format\n- Ensured proper logging of version information\n\n## Benefits\n- Eliminated CS7035 warnings about version string format\n- Eliminated IL3000 warnings about Assembly.Location in single-file apps\n- More compliant with Microsoft's recommended practices\n- Improved traceability of builds with standardized version numbers\n- Better compatibility with single-file publishing\n\n## Implementation Details\n- Local builds: Version is `1.0.[days since 2024-01-01].[seconds since midnight/2]`\n- CI builds: Version is `1.0.[days since 2024-01-01].[GitHub run number]`\n- Both build systems set the same environment variables for consistent versioning",
