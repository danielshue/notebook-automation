  "title": "CLI Exception Handling Centralization Complete",
  "details": "Successfully completed the centralization of exception handling across all CLI command classes in the NotebookAutomation.CLI project:\n\n## What was accomplished:\n1. **Centralized Exception Handler**: Created `ExceptionHandler` utility in `NotebookAutomation.Cli.Utilities` that handles exceptions gracefully based on DEBUG mode.\n\n2. **Global Using**: Confirmed `NotebookAutomation.Cli.Utilities` is already included in GlobalUsings.cs for the project.\n\n3. **Updated All Command Classes**:\n   - **VaultCommands**: 3 catch blocks updated to use ExceptionHandler\n   - **TagCommands**: Already using ExceptionHandler (3 catch blocks)\n   - **MarkdownCommands**: 2 catch blocks updated to use ExceptionHandler\n   - **VideoCommands**: 1 catch block updated to use ExceptionHandler\n   - **PdfCommands**: 3 catch blocks updated to use ExceptionHandler\n   - **OneDriveCommands**: 1 catch block updated to use ExceptionHandler\n   - **ConfigCommands**: 3 catch blocks updated to use ExceptionHandler (2 that handle actual exceptions, 1 ArgumentException left as-is for usage display)\n   - **VersionCommands**: No catch blocks found\n\n4. **Exception Handling Behavior**:\n   - In DEBUG mode: Shows full exception details including stack trace\n   - In normal mode: Shows user-friendly error messages\n   - All exceptions are properly logged for tracking\n\n5. **Build Verification**: All changes compile successfully and the solution builds without errors.\n\n## Total Changes:\n- 16 catch blocks now use `ExceptionHandler.HandleException()`\n- All major exception scenarios are handled consistently\n- Legacy error handling patterns have been replaced with centralized approach\n\nThe CLI now has consistent, graceful exception handling across all command classes, providing better user experience in normal mode and detailed debugging information when needed.",
