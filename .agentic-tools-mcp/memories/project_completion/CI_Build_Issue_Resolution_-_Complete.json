  "details": "## GitHub Actions CI Build Fix - Resolution Complete\n\n**Problem Resolved:** \nThe GitHub Actions CI build was failing due to an incorrect path construction in the local build script `scripts/build-ci-local.ps1`. The script was using `$ScriptDir` instead of `$RepositoryRoot` when constructing the path to the CLI project for the publish step.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nLine 202 in `scripts/build-ci-local.ps1` was:\n```\n$cliProjectPath = Join-Path $ScriptDir \"src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\"\n```\nThis created an invalid path like `d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\scripts\\src\\c-sharp\\...` instead of the correct `d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\...`\n\n**Solution Applied:**\nFixed the path construction to use the correct base directory:\n```\n$cliProjectPath = Join-Path $RepositoryRoot \"src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj\"\n```\n\n**Verification Steps Completed:**\n1. ✅ Identified the issue through local testing of the build script\n2. ✅ Applied the fix to `scripts/build-ci-local.ps1`\n3. ✅ Verified the fix works by running local CI build script successfully\n4. ✅ Committed and pushed the fix to the repository (commit 2829207)\n5. ✅ Confirmed GitHub Actions workflow uses correct paths and doesn't have the same issue\n\n**GitHub Actions Workflow Analysis:**\nThe GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml` uses correct hardcoded paths:\n- `src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Cli/NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj`\n- The workflow changes to `${{ github.workspace }}` before running publish commands\n- This ensures relative paths work correctly in the CI environment\n\n**Status:** RESOLVED\n- Local build script is now fixed and working\n- Changes have been pushed to repository\n- Next GitHub Actions run should pass successfully\n- Build pipeline integrity restored",
