  "title": "Unused Classes Identified and Removed",
  "details": "## Successfully Identified and Removed Unused Classes\n\n### Confirmed Unused Classes - REMOVED:\n1. **OpenAiConfig.cs** - Empty file with no content, no references ✅ REMOVED\n2. **HtmlToMarkdownConverter.cs** - Complete class with tests but never integrated into main application:\n   - Had unit tests but no actual usage in application code\n   - Not registered in DI container\n   - MarkdownNoteProcessor uses its own StripHtmlTags method instead\n   - Had TODO comments about using \"real HTML-to-markdown converter\" suggesting it was planned but never implemented\n   - ✅ REMOVED\n3. **ICustomLogger.cs + CustomLogger class** - Interface and implementation only used in their own tests:\n   - Not registered in DI container\n   - Not referenced in CLI or any application code\n   - Only used in CustomLoggerTests.cs (which was also removed)\n   - ✅ REMOVED (including CustomLoggerTests.cs)\n\n### Previously Removed:\n- **ConfigProvider.cs** - Service Locator anti-pattern, replaced by proper DI approach ✅ REMOVED\n- **LoggingServiceAndConfigProviderTests.cs** - Associated test file ✅ REMOVED\n\n### Total Classes/Files Removed: 7 files\n- OpenAiConfig.cs\n- HtmlToMarkdownConverter.cs  \n- HtmlToMarkdownConverterTests.cs\n- ICustomLogger.cs (contained both interface and implementation)\n- CustomLoggerTests.cs\n- ConfigProvider.cs (from earlier)\n- LoggingServiceAndConfigProviderTests.cs (from earlier)\n\n### Analysis Methodology:\n- Used `list_code_usages` tool to verify actual usage patterns across codebase\n- Checked DI container registration in ServiceRegistration.cs\n- Verified no CLI command dependencies with grep searches\n- Confirmed test-only vs. application-integrated classes\n- Built and tested after each removal to ensure stability\n\n### Classes Verified as NEEDED (not dead code):\n- FileSizeFormatter - used in VideoNoteProcessor\n- YamlHelper - widely used across application (21+ usages)\n- PathFormatter - used in LoggerExtensions  \n- FailedOperations - used in LoggingService\n- PathsConfig - extensively used in AppConfig\n- MicrosoftGraphConfig - used in AppConfig\n- AIServiceConfig - used in AppConfig and CLI\n- All processor classes (Video, PDF, Markdown, Tag) - used in CLI commands\n- All service classes - registered and used in DI container\n- ITextChunkingService - properly used in AISummarizer with dependency injection\n\n### Final Status:\n✅ All tests pass (no count change needed due to removal of test-only classes)\n✅ Clean build successful\n✅ Technical debt reduced by removing 7 unused files\n✅ Codebase simplified and more maintainable",
