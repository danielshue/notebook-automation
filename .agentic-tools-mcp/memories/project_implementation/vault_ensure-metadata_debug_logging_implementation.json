  "details": "Successfully implemented detailed debug logging for the vault ensure-metadata command. The solution provides two distinct logging modes:\n\n## Normal Mode (without --debug):\n- Console: Shows animated progress spinner and concise completion summary\n- Log file: Contains only summary lines like \"Metadata change summary for file test-lecture.md: +7 ~0 -0\"\n\n## Debug Mode (with --debug):\n- Console: Shows animated progress plus detailed console output of proposed changes\n- Log file: Contains both summary AND detailed breakdown:\n  - Summary: \"Metadata change summary for file test-lecture.md: +7 ~0 -0\"\n  - Detailed block format showing what fields are being added/modified/deleted\n  - Detailed key-value operations with actual values\n\n## Implementation Details:\n- Enhanced LoggerExtensions.cs with general string formatting methods (LogDebugFormatted, LogInformationFormatted, etc.)\n- Updated MetadataEnsureProcessor.cs LogMetadataChanges method to log detailed changes at Debug level and summaries at Info level\n- Fixed VaultCommands.cs to use correct config parameter handling\n- Removed \"TODO\" from command descriptions\n- Added proper animated progress indicators using AnsiConsoleHelper\n\n## Key Features:\n- Summary format uses \"+X ~Y -Z\" pattern (additions, modifications, deletions)\n- Debug details show exact key-value pairs being changed\n- Logs are written to timestamped files in the logs directory\n- Debug information only appears in log file when --debug flag is used\n- Console output remains clean and user-friendly in both modes\n\n## Testing:\n- Verified with test markdown file at d:\\temp\\test-vault\\Course\\Module 1\\Lecture\\test-lecture.md\n- Confirmed proper behavior in both normal and debug modes\n- Verified log file contains appropriate level of detail based on debug flag",
