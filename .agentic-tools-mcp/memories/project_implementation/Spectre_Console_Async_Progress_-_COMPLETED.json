  "title": "Spectre Console Async Progress - COMPLETED",
  "details": "COMPLETED:\n- Resolved compilation errors in AnsiConsoleHelper.cs by fixing the Spectre.Console Spinner extension method usage\n- Replaced incorrect .Spinner() extension methods on Task<T> with proper AnsiConsole.Status() pattern\n- Updated WithSpinnerAsync methods to use Func<Task<T>> instead of Task<T> extension methods\n- Upgraded Spectre.Console package to version 0.50.0 to match Spectre.Console.Cli dependency\n- Successfully integrated Spectre.Console async progress with the MetadataEnsureBatchProcessor eventing system\n- Updated VaultCommands.cs to use the new SpectreConsoleBatchProgressReporter instead of custom spinner\n- Progress reporter now shows real-time progress with progress bars, percentages, remaining time, and spinner\n- Events from MetadataEnsureBatchProcessor (ProcessingProgressChanged, QueueChanged) now update Spectre.Console progress display\n- Build verification successful - all compilation errors resolved\n\nINTEGRATION PATTERN:\n- CreateBatchProgressReporter() creates IBatchProgressReporter instance\n- Progress reporter subscribes to batch processor events (ProcessingProgressChanged, QueueChanged)\n- StartAsync() begins Spectre.Console progress display\n- UpdateProgress() and UpdateQueue() methods update display in real-time\n- StopAsync() cleanly terminates progress display\n- Proper exception handling ensures progress reporter is always stopped\n\nTESTING NEEDED:\n- End-to-end CLI testing with real vault directory\n- Verify progress display shows correctly during batch processing\n- Test dry-run mode with progress display\n- Verify error handling works correctly with progress reporter\n\nREMAINING WORK:\n- Optional: Remove or deprecate legacy custom spinner if no longer needed\n- Performance testing with large vault directories\n- Documentation updates for new Spectre.Console integration",
