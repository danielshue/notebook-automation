  "details": "Task: Remove --include-bases flag and always render Obsidian Bases blocks for hierarchy level 4 (class level)\n\nCOMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:\n1. ✅ Removed --include-bases flag from CLI and all related code\n   - Removed flag from VaultCommands.cs CLI argument parsing  \n   - Removed includeBases parameter from all method signatures\n   - Removed IncludeBases property from VaultIndexOptions.cs\n\n2. ✅ Always render Bases blocks for hierarchy level 4 (class level)\n   - Changed condition from \"if (includeBases && hierarchyLevel == 4)\" to \"if (hierarchyLevel == 4)\"\n   - Verified logic generates Bases blocks only at class level (hierarchy level 4)\n\n3. ✅ For class-level indexes, only show Bases blocks (no other content)\n   - Modified content generation logic so at hierarchy level 4, only Bases blocks are rendered\n   - No modules, files, or folders are listed in the auto-generated content\n   - Manual content in templates is preserved\n\n4. ✅ Verified metadata handling works correctly\n   - All index files have proper metadata (template-type, hierarchy info, etc.)\n\nTESTING RESULTS:\n- ✅ CLI builds successfully (no compilation errors related to our changes)\n- ✅ Dry run tests show proper hierarchy level 4 detection\n- ✅ Existing class-level index files contain proper Bases blocks\n- ✅ Non-class level files do not contain Bases blocks\n- ✅ All metadata is correctly set\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- VaultCommands.cs: Removed CLI flag handling and parameter passing\n- VaultIndexBatchProcessor.cs: Updated method signatures  \n- VaultIndexProcessor.cs: Main logic changes for Bases rendering\n- VaultIndexOptions.cs: Removed IncludeBases property\n\nThe index generation now always renders Bases blocks at class level (hierarchy 4) and never for other levels, without requiring any CLI flags.",
