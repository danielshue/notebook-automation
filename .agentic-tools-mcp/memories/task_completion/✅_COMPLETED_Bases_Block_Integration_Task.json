  "title": "âœ… COMPLETED: Bases Block Integration Task",
  "details": "## Task Completion Summary\n\nSuccessfully completed the Bases block integration task with all requirements met:\n\n### âœ… Completed Requirements:\n1. **Removed --include-bases flag and all related code** from CLI and core logic\n2. **Always render Obsidian Bases blocks for hierarchy level 4 (class level)** and only at that level\n3. **For class-level indexes, show only Bases blocks** (no other modules, files, or folders)\n4. **Ensure correct metadata for all index files** \n5. **Generated extensive sample content** (readings, instructions, case studies, and especially videos) under each class folder\n6. **Instructions and videos under \"Module\" folders** to test module filtering\n7. **Committed all changes** with a well-structured commit message\n8. **Fixed and updated tests** - all tests passing\n\n### âœ… Verification Results:\n- **Class-level index files** (e.g., Corporate-Finance.md, Digital-Marketing Class.md) show only Bases blocks for different content types (Readings, Instructions, Case Studies, Videos)\n- **Course-level index files** (e.g., Finance I Course.md) show regular folder navigation, NOT Bases blocks\n- **Module filtering working correctly** with proper sort order by module column\n- **Correct metadata applied** to all index files with appropriate template-type, program, course, class fields\n- **All tests passing** with no compilation errors\n\n### ðŸ“‹ Files Modified:\n- CLI: VaultCommands.cs (removed --include-bases flag)\n- Core: VaultIndexBatchProcessor.cs, VaultIndexProcessor.cs (updated logic)\n- Models: VaultIndexOptions.cs (removed IncludeBases property)\n- Test content: Generated extensive sample content under multiple class folders\n\n### ðŸŽ¯ Final State:\nThe vault index generation now automatically renders Bases blocks at class level (hierarchy level 4) only, providing proper content filtering while maintaining clean navigation at other hierarchy levels. The implementation successfully filters and displays content by type (readings, instructions, case studies, videos) with module-based sorting for educational content organization.\n\nCommit: feat(vault): remove include-bases flag and always render bases blocks at class level [a8910fa]",
