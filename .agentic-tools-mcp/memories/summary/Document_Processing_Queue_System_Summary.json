  "details": "# Document Processing Queue System Summary\n\n## Implementation Complete\n\nWe've successfully implemented a generic document processing queue system in the `DocumentNoteBatchProcessor<TProcessor>` class that provides comprehensive tracking and status updates for both PDF and video processing (or any future document types).\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Document Type Agnostic Design**\n   - Auto-detects document types based on file extension\n   - Works with both PDFs and videos in the same system\n   - Provides type-specific metadata storage\n   - Shows statistics by document type in summary\n\n2. **Detailed Status Tracking**\n   - Queue items track current processing stage\n   - Each stage (extraction, AI summary, markdown) has dedicated tracking\n   - Timestamps for start/completion\n   - Detailed status messages for UI display\n\n3. **Rich Event System**\n   - `QueueChanged` event notifies when queue state changes\n   - `ProcessingProgressChanged` maintains backward compatibility with current UI\n   - Event args provide full context about changes\n\n4. **Thread-Safe Implementation**\n   - Lock-protected queue access\n   - Proper synchronization for multi-threaded access\n   - Safe event triggering\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **UI Implementation**\n   - We can now build a rich UI using Spectre.Console's Layout feature\n   - The UI will consume the queue information through the events\n   - We can create live-updating panels showing queue items, current progress, and statistics\n\n2. **Additional Queue Features**\n   - Priority processing\n   - Pause/resume functionality\n   - More detailed per-document metadata\n\n3. **Unit Testing**\n   - Add unit tests for queue functionality\n   - Ensure events fire correctly\n   - Test document type detection\n\n## Impact\n\nThis implementation:\n\n1. Dramatically improves the potential UI experience without breaking backward compatibility\n2. Provides a solid foundation for future enhancements\n3. Improves reporting and status tracking\n4. Makes the system more maintainable and extensible\n5. Allows for more advanced queue management in the future\n\nThe solution compiles successfully and is ready for testing.",
