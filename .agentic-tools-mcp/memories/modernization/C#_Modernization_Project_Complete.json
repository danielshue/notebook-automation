  "details": "Successfully completed the C# modernization effort for the Notebook Automation project. This included:\n\n## Completed Tasks:\n1. **Updated Copilot Instructions**: Modified both .github/copilot-instructions.md and .github/copilot-codeGeneration-instructions.md to enforce modern C# 12+ features including:\n   - File-scoped namespaces as the standard\n   - Primary constructors for dependency injection scenarios\n   - Collection expressions for initialization\n   - Pattern matching and switch expressions\n   - Target-typed new expressions\n   - Modern exception handling patterns\n\n2. **Namespace Conversion**: Successfully converted all 73+ C# files in src/c-sharp/ from brace-style namespaces to file-scoped namespaces using custom PowerShell scripts:\n   - Created convert-namespace.ps1 for individual file conversion\n   - Created convert-all-namespaces.ps1 for batch processing\n   - Ran dotnet format to ensure proper code formatting\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - Built the solution successfully with no errors\n   - Verified that no brace-style namespaces remain in the codebase\n   - Confirmed all files now use proper file-scoped namespace syntax\n   - Checked sample files for correct formatting and indentation\n\n## Results:\n- All C# files now follow modern C# 12+ conventions\n- Copilot is configured to generate code using these modern features\n- Build passes successfully\n- Code formatting is consistent throughout the project\n- Project task marked as completed\n\nThis modernization effort ensures the codebase follows current C# best practices and will help maintain consistency as new code is generated by Copilot.",
