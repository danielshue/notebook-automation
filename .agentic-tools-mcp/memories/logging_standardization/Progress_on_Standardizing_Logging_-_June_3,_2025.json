  "title": "Progress on Standardizing Logging - June 3, 2025",
  "details": "Today we made significant progress on standardizing logging in the Notebook Automation C# project. We focused on fixing constructor calls and parameter signatures across multiple files.\n\n✅ Completed:\n1. Fixed TagCommands.cs in the CLI project\n   - Added code to retrieve IYamlHelper from the DI container\n   - Updated all TagProcessor constructor calls to include the YamlHelper parameter\n   - Verified the CLI project builds successfully\n\n2. Fixed several test files:\n   - TagProcessorTests.cs - fixed all constructor calls including those with custom field collections\n   - VideoNoteProcessorTests.cs - fixed constructor calls\n   - VideoNoteProcessorDITests.cs - fixed constructor calls \n   - VideoProcessing/VideoNoteProcessorNoSummaryTests.cs - fixed constructor calls\n   - VideoProcessing/VideoNoteProcessorShareLinkContentTests.cs - added Mock<IYamlHelper> field and initialization\n\n3. Created a project and tasks to track the standardization work\n\n⚠️ In progress:\n1. VideoNoteProcessorMetadataTests.cs - added fields and initialization, but still needs constructor call updates (6 instances)\n2. Utils/MetadataTemplateManagerTests.cs - needs to be updated (6 instances)\n\nThe latest pattern for VideoNoteProcessor constructor calls is:\n```csharp\nVideoNoteProcessor processor = new(\n    loggerMock.Object,\n    aiSummarizer,\n    yamlHelperMock.Object,\n    oneDriveServiceMock.Object,\n    appConfig\n);\n```\n\nThis standardization ensures all logging goes through the centralized LoggingService, maintaining consistency and enabling better log management across the codebase.",
