  "details": "TASK: Ensure all processors use VaultRootContextService for vault root override, injected via DI.\n\nCOMPLETED WORK:\n1. ✅ Searched for all processors and identified those using MetadataHierarchyDetector\n2. ✅ Updated processors to use DI-injected MetadataHierarchyDetector:\n   - VideoNoteProcessor\n   - PdfNoteProcessor \n   - MarkdownNoteProcessor\n   - MetadataEnsureProcessor\n3. ✅ Updated ServiceRegistration.cs to register all processors with proper DI and VaultRootContextService\n4. ✅ Updated CLI command classes to set VaultRootContextService.VaultRootOverride:\n   - VideoCommands - uses scoped DI, sets vault root override to effective output directory\n   - PdfCommands - uses scoped DI, sets vault root override to effective output directory\n   - MarkdownCommands - uses scoped DI, sets vault root override to effective output directory\n   - TagCommands - confirmed does not need vault root context\n5. ✅ Fixed ServiceRegistration.cs compilation issues and added missing MarkdownNoteProcessor registration\n6. ✅ Main code builds successfully\n\nREMAINING WORK:\n- Fix unit tests that need updating for new processor constructor signatures\n- Test the updated commands to ensure VaultRootContextService.VaultRootOverride works correctly\n- Validate hierarchy metadata is correct in generated index files\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n- All main code compiles successfully\n- DI properly configured for VaultRootContextService integration\n- Command classes properly set vault root override in scoped context\n- Ready for testing and validation",
