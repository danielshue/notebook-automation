  "details": "# MetadataHierarchyDetector Refactoring\n\nThe `MetadataHierarchyDetector` class has been refactored to eliminate hard-coded strings and path handling logic, making it fully based on the vault structure.\n\n## Key Changes\n\n1. **Removed hard-coded strings**:\n   - Eliminated special program identifiers (e.g., \"Value Chain Management\")\n   - Removed special path handling for specific program structures\n\n2. **Structure-Based Hierarchy Detection**:\n   - All hierarchy detection now uses the vault root as the anchor point\n   - Added support for detecting hierarchy based on index file types in folders\n   - Program, course, class, and module levels are now determined by position in folder hierarchy\n   - Improved support for minimal vaults (e.g., those with only class index pages with bases)\n\n3. **Enhanced Fallback Logic**:\n   - If index files aren't found, the code falls back to folder structure relative to vault root\n   - Proper hierarchical fallback for all levels (program, course, class, module)\n   - Uses vault root folder name as ultimate fallback for program\n   - Properly handles folders starting with periods (skips them)\n\n4. **Added Module Support**:\n   - Added detection for module metadata in the hierarchy\n   - Extended `UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy` to support consistent module metadata\n\n5. **Improved Architecture**:\n   - Better separation of explicit parameters, index-file detection, and path-based fallbacks\n   - Enhanced logging for troubleshooting\n   - More robust and clearer code structure\n   - Better docstrings and examples\n\nThis refactoring ensures that the hierarchy detection is purely based on structure and relationships to the vault root, with no hard-coded values. The code will now work correctly with various vault structures, including minimal vaults with only class-level content.",
