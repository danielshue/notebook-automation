  "title": "CourseStructureExtractor Enhancement Complete",
  "details": "Successfully enhanced the CourseStructureExtractor in the NotebookAutomation C# project to improve metadata extraction robustness. The enhancement focused on ensuring that module and lesson information is reliably captured from both filenames and parent directory structures.\n\n**Problem Solved:**\nOriginally, the extraction logic had several limitations:\n- Single-level courses incorrectly set both module and lesson metadata\n- Filename-based extraction didn't handle camelCase properly (e.g., \"BasicConcepts\" vs \"Basic Concepts\")\n- Limited support for various naming conventions (Week, Unit, Session, Class patterns)\n- Poor handling of numbered directory patterns\n\n**Key Improvements Implemented:**\n\n1. **Enhanced Filename Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Added WeekUnitFilenameRegex for \"Week1-Introduction\", \"Unit2-Advanced\", etc.\n   - Improved ModuleFilenameRegex and LessonFilenameRegex with proper capture groups\n   - Added support for compact patterns like \"Module1BasicConcepts\"\n\n2. **Fixed Directory Logic:**\n   - Single-level courses now correctly set only module, not lesson\n   - Enhanced hierarchical fallback to only treat current directory as lesson when parent looks like module container\n   - Better numbered pattern recognition for directory structures\n\n3. **Improved Text Processing:**\n   - Added CamelCaseRegex to convert \"BasicConcepts\" â†’ \"Basic Concepts\"\n   - Enhanced CleanModuleOrLessonName method with camelCase handling\n   - Better title case formatting and cleanup\n\n4. **Test Results:**\n   - All 23 CourseStructureExtractor tests now pass (was 18/23 before)\n   - Handles edge cases like Case Studies that may not have lessons\n   - Proper fallback strategies when extraction fails\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core/Utils/CourseStructureExtractor.cs\n- Enhanced regex patterns, improved extraction logic, added camelCase support\n\n**Key Regex Patterns Added:**\n- WeekUnitFilenameRegex: @\"(?i)(week|unit|session|class)\\s*[_-]?\\s*(\\d+)[_-]?\\s*(.+?)(?:\\.\\w+)?$\"\n- CamelCaseRegex: @\"(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])\" for converting camelCase to spaces\n- Enhanced ModuleFilenameRegex and LessonFilenameRegex with proper capture groups\n\nThe extraction logic now robustly handles various course structure naming conventions and provides accurate metadata for YAML frontmatter generation.",
