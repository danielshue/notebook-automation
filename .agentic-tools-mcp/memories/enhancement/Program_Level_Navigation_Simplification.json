  "title": "Program Level Navigation Simplification",
  "details": "Updated VaultIndexProcessor navigation logic to improve the user experience at the Program Level by removing unnecessary back navigation.\n\n## Change Details:\n- **Program Level (hierarchyLevel == 1)**: Now shows only \"🏠 [[Home]] | 📊 [[Dashboard]] | 📝 [[Classes Assignments]]\" without the back navigation\n- **All other levels**: Continue to show the full navigation with back link \"🔙 [[BackTarget|BackText]] | 🏠 [[Home]] | 📊 [[Dashboard]] | 📝 [[Classes Assignments]]\"\n\n## Rationale:\n- At Program Level, users are already at the top organizational level below the main vault root\n- Back navigation from Program Level would just go to the vault root (Home), which is redundant with the Home link\n- This creates a cleaner, less cluttered navigation experience\n- Maintains all other navigation elements (Home, Dashboard, Assignments) for consistency\n\n## Implementation:\n- Modified the navigation generation logic in GenerateIndexContentAsync method\n- Added conditional logic to handle Program Level differently\n- Reorganized the navigation code for better readability and maintainability\n- Moved the root index filename lookup outside the conditional blocks for efficiency\n\n## Testing:\n- All 19 VaultIndexProcessor tests pass\n- All 6 VaultCommands CLI tests pass  \n- No regressions introduced\n- Build successful with no compilation errors",
