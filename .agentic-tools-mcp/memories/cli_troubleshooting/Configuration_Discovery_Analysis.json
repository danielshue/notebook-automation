  "details": "Analysis of CLI configuration file discovery behavior:\n\nFINDING: Configuration discovery is working correctly. When running the CLI executable (na.exe) from any directory, it successfully finds the config.json file.\n\nTESTED:\n- Ran D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\dist\\win-arm64\\na.exe from C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\OneDrive\\Education\\Fall 2024\\...\n- CLI successfully found and loaded: D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\config\\config.json\n- Debug output confirmed: \"Configuration loaded successfully\"\n\nDISCOVERY LOGIC WORKING:\n1. CLI option (--config) - highest priority\n2. Environment variable (NOTEBOOKAUTOMATION_CONFIG)\n3. Current working directory (config.json)\n4. Executable directory (config.json)\n5. Executable/config subdirectory (config/config.json)\n\nThe executable is using AppContext.BaseDirectory which correctly resolves to the executable's directory even when run from a different working directory.\n\nACTUAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED: The config commands (config view, config update) were using the old AppConfig.FindConfigFile() method instead of the centralized ConfigManager discovery system. This caused inconsistency where the main CLI would find the config file but the config commands would fail.\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n- Refactored ConfigCommands from static to instance class with dependency injection\n- Updated ConfigCommands to use ConfigManager instead of AppConfig.FindConfigFile()\n- Updated all config command handlers to use centralized discovery logic\n- Fixed all related test files to work with the new dependency injection pattern\n- All 25 ConfigCommands tests now pass\n\nRESULT: Both main CLI and config commands now use consistent configuration discovery and work correctly from any directory.",
