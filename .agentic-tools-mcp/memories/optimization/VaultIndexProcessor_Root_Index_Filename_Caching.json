  "title": "VaultIndexProcessor Root Index Filename Caching",
  "details": "Implemented caching optimization for the GetRootIndexFilename method in VaultIndexProcessor to avoid expensive file system lookups.\n\n## Implementation Details:\n- Added private fields _cachedRootIndexFilename and _cachedVaultPath to store cached values\n- GetRootIndexFilename now checks if the vault path matches the cached path and returns cached filename if available\n- After performing the expensive file system lookup, the method caches both the result and the vault path\n- This prevents repeated file system scans when generating multiple index files in the same vault\n\n## Key Changes:\n- Modified GetRootIndexFilename method to implement caching logic\n- Cache is invalidated when vault path changes\n- No breaking changes to public API or method signatures\n- All existing tests continue to pass\n\n## Performance Impact:\n- Eliminates redundant file system traversals during batch index generation\n- Particularly beneficial when processing multiple folders in the same vault\n- Maintains thread safety as processor instances are typically short-lived\n\n## Testing:\n- All 19 VaultIndexProcessor tests pass\n- All 6 VaultCommands CLI tests pass\n- No regressions introduced\n- Build successful with no compilation errors",
