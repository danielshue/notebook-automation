  "title": "Fixed Video Commands CLI Progress Reporting",
  "details": "## Issue\nThe progress reporting in VideoCommands.cs was printing new lines for each animation update instead of updating in place, causing excessive output in the console.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe VideoCommands.cs was using the newer Spectre.Console `WithStatusAsync` method but not correctly implementing the pattern for in-place progress updates. Meanwhile, PdfCommands.cs was still using the older custom spinner implementation with `StartSpinner`, `UpdateSpinnerMessage`, and `StopSpinner` methods.\n\n## Solution Applied\n1. Updated the VideoCommands.cs implementation to correctly use the Spectre.Console `WithStatusAsync` method:\n   - Ensured proper markup escaping for status text using `.Replace(\"[\", \"[[\").Replace(\"]\", \"]]\")`\n   - Used the `updateStatus` callback to update the status message in place\n\n2. Removed the redundant `AnsiConsoleHelper.StopSpinner()` call in the catch block, as the WithStatusAsync method automatically handles spinner cleanup.\n\n3. The updated implementation in VideoCommands.cs now provides in-place progress updates without printing a new line for each animation update, matching the behavior of PdfCommands.cs.\n\n## Note on Future Consistency\nThere is an inconsistency in how progress reporting is implemented across commands:\n- VideoCommands.cs now uses the newer Spectre.Console `WithStatusAsync` pattern\n- PdfCommands.cs still uses the older custom spinner implementation\n\nIn the future, for better consistency, it would be beneficial to update PdfCommands.cs to use the same newer Spectre.Console pattern as VideoCommands.cs.",
