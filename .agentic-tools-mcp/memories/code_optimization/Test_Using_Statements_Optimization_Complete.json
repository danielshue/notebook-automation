  "title": "Test Using Statements Optimization Complete",
  "details": "Completed optimization of using statements in the NotebookAutomation test projects:\n\nTASK: Optimize using statements so that Task is used instead of System.Threading.Tasks.Task\n\nFINDINGS:\n✅ ConfigCommandsTests.cs already optimized - uses file-scoped namespace and relies on global usings\n✅ All test files are already using the short 'Task' form in method signatures (e.g., 'public async Task TestMethod()')\n✅ No test files contain fully qualified 'System.Threading.Tasks.Task' references\n✅ Global usings properly configured in all test projects:\n   - NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/GlobalUsings.cs\n   - NotebookAutomation.Cli.Tests/GlobalUsings.cs\n\nRESULTS:\n- All test files are already optimally structured with file-scoped namespaces\n- Global usings handle common types like Task, eliminating need for explicit using statements\n- Test method signatures consistently use 'async Task' instead of 'async System.Threading.Tasks.Task'\n- No changes required - code is already in optimal state\n\nSTATUS: COMPLETED ✅",
