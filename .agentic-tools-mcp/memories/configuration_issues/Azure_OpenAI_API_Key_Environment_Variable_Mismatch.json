  "title": "Azure OpenAI API Key Variable Mismatch - RESOLVED",
  "details": "RESOLVED: Fixed critical configuration mismatch in the Azure OpenAI API key environment variable names.\n\nOriginal Issue:\n1. AIServiceConfig.GetApiKey() method expected: AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_KEY\n2. ServiceRegistration.RegisterAIServices() method expected: AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\n\nThis discrepancy caused Azure OpenAI configuration to fail because the two parts of the system were looking for different environment variable names.\n\nFix Applied:\n- Updated AIServiceConfig.GetApiKey() method to use AZURE_OPENAI_KEY (matching ServiceRegistration.cs)\n- Updated documentation comments to reflect the correct environment variable name\n- Both parts of the system now consistently use AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\n\nThe error \"OpenAI configuration is missing or incomplete. Exiting.\" should now be resolved since both configuration validation and service registration use the same environment variable name.",
