Recent runs show:\n- 2025-06-11T17:51:27Z: SUCCESS \n- 2025-06-11T17:40:37Z: SUCCESS\n- Earlier runs: Some failures\n\nThe issue with \"1.0.0-beta\" version persisting is likely because:\n1. The successful builds still contain development versions (built before versioning fixes)\n2. The builds may be using development configuration\n3. Need to verify the CI workflow is actually applying dynamic versioning\n\nThe \"Repository not found\" issue appears to be resolved, builds are completing successfully.",
