  "details": "## Fixed: CLI Version Reporting Issue\n\n**Problem**: The `na.exe --version` command was always reporting \"1.0.0-beta\" regardless of the CI build version.\n\n**Root Cause**: The CI workflow was setting version properties (`/p:Version`, `/p:FileVersion`, `/p:AssemblyVersion`, `/p:InformationalVersion`) during the build step, but the publish steps (which create the actual executables) were not including the same version overrides.\n\n**Solution**: Updated the `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml` file to include `/p:InformationalVersion=${{ env.FILE_VERSION }}` in both publish steps:\n\n1. `Publish single-file EXE (win-x64)` step\n2. `Publish single-file EXE (win-arm64)` step\n\n**Technical Details**:\n- The CLI version command uses `FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo(exePath).FileVersion` to retrieve version info\n- During `dotnet publish`, the version properties must be explicitly passed to ensure they're embedded in the final executable\n- Without the version overrides in publish steps, the executable was using the default version from `Directory.Build.props` (1.0.0-beta)\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml`: Added `/p:InformationalVersion` to both publish commands\n\n**Verification**:\n- Committed fix on commit bda8fa7\n- New CI build triggered (ID: 15592923492)\n- Next step: Download artifact from successful build and verify `na.exe --version` reports correct CI version\n\n**Related Scripts**:\n- `scripts/download-latest-artifact.ps1`: Already updated to use relative paths and copy full config directory",
