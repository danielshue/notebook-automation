  "title": "Ensure-metadata skips dot directories",
  "details": "The ensure-metadata process has been updated to skip directories that start with a period (e.g., .obsidian, .git).\n\nImplementation details:\n1. Added GetMarkdownFilesExcludingDotDirectories helper method in MetadataEnsureBatchProcessor.cs\n2. Added GetMarkdownFilesRecursive helper method that recursively searches for markdown files while skipping directories that start with a period\n3. Updated InitializeProcessingQueue to use GetMarkdownFilesExcludingDotDirectories instead of Directory.GetFiles with recursive search\n4. The implementation checks Path.GetFileName(subDirectory).StartsWith('.') to skip dot-prefixed directories\n5. Still processes markdown files in the current directory but skips any hidden files that start with '.'\n\nThe logic properly handles:\n- Skipping .obsidian directories (Obsidian configuration)\n- Skipping .git directories (Git repositories)\n- Skipping any other dot-prefixed directories\n- Still processing markdown files in non-dot directories recursively",
