  "title": "Document Processing Queue System Implementation",
  "details": "# Document Processing Queue System Implementation\n\nWe've implemented a comprehensive document processing queue system in the `DocumentNoteBatchProcessor` class that provides enhanced tracking and event notification while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing UI.\n\n## Key Components Added\n\n1. **Document Processing Status Enum**\n   - `Waiting` - Document is in queue waiting to be processed\n   - `Processing` - Document is currently being processed\n   - `Completed` - Document was successfully processed\n   - `Failed` - Processing failed\n\n2. **Processing Stage Enum**\n   - `NotStarted` - Initial state\n   - `ContentExtraction` - Extracting text/transcription\n   - `AISummaryGeneration` - Generating AI summary\n   - `MarkdownCreation` - Creating markdown note\n   - `ShareLinkGeneration` - Generating OneDrive links\n   - `Completed` - Processing finished\n\n3. **QueueItem Class**\n   - Tracks file path, status, document type, processing stage\n   - Includes timing information (start/end times)\n   - Stores metadata specific to the document\n   - Maintains status messages for UI display\n\n4. **QueueChangedEventArgs**\n   - Provides the current queue state\n   - Identifies which specific item changed\n\n5. **Queue Management**\n   - Thread-safe queue operations with locking\n   - Document type detection based on file extension\n   - Queue status updates at each processing stage\n   - Detailed batch summary with queue statistics\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Rich Status Information**\n   - Detailed progress tracking through various stages\n   - Document-specific metadata and timing information\n   - Success/failure statistics by document type\n\n2. **Generic Design**\n   - Works for both PDF and video files (or any other document types added in the future)\n   - Auto-detects document type from file extension\n   - Extensible metadata dictionary for type-specific information\n\n3. **Ready for UI Improvements**\n   - Provides a solid foundation for richer UI implementation\n   - Maintains backward compatibility with current UI\n   - Gives access to the full processing queue state\n\n4. **Enhanced Reporting**\n   - Added document type statistics to summary\n   - Added status breakdown (completed/failed)\n   - Maintains all existing timing and token statistics\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Implement a rich UI using Spectre.Console's Layout features that leverages the queue information\n2. Add more document-specific metadata to enrich the UI display\n3. Consider adding processing priority to the queue system\n4. Add pause/resume functionality for long processing queues",
