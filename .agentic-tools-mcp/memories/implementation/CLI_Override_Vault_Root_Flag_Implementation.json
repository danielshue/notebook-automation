  "title": "CLI Override Vault Root Flag Implementation",
  "details": "Successfully implemented the --override-vault-root flag as a boolean option for the vault generate-index command. Key changes:\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED:\n- Fixed CLI command so --override-vault-root is now a boolean flag instead of requiring the path to be entered twice\n- When --override-vault-root is specified, the provided path argument is used as the vault root\n\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:\n1. Changed vaultRootOverrideOption from Option<string> to Option<bool> in VaultCommands.cs\n2. Updated handler logic to use path argument as vault root when flag is true:\n   - generateIndexCommand: `string? vaultRoot = overrideVaultRoot ? path : null;`\n   - ensureMetadataCommand: same logic\n   - cleanIndexCommand: same logic\n\n3. Updated help text documentation to reflect boolean nature of flag\n\nUSAGE:\n- OLD (broken): `na vault generate-index \"path\" --override-vault-root \"path\"`  \n- NEW (working): `na vault generate-index \"path\" --override-vault-root`\n\nVALIDATION:\n- Tested with MBA vault structure - works perfectly\n- All hierarchy levels calculated correctly (level 1 for MBA root, level 2+ for subfolders)\n- Main index (MBA.md) generated with proper template-type: main\n- All subfolders processed with correct template types and hierarchy metadata\n- Help text shows correct boolean flag usage\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- d:\\source\\notebook-automation\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Cli\\Commands\\VaultCommands.cs\n\nOTHER COMMANDS:\n- Other command classes (VideoCommands, TagCommands, etc.) have their own separate vaultRootOverrideOption definitions as string options, which is correct for their use cases",
