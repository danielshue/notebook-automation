  "details": "## Relative Path Support Implementation - Completed Successfully\n\n### Implementation Summary\nSuccessfully added relative path support to video-notes and pdf-notes CLI commands. Users can now specify relative paths that get automatically resolved against the OneDrive root directory.\n\n### Key Components Added:\n\n1. **PathUtils.ResolveInputPath() Method**\n   - Location: NotebookAutomation.Core/Utils/PathUtils.cs\n   - Functionality: Resolves relative paths by prepending OneDrive root\n   - Features: Path.IsPathRooted() check, null handling, path normalization\n\n2. **Command Integration**\n   - Modified: VideoCommands.cs and PdfCommands.cs\n   - Added path resolution before processing input\n   - Maintains backwards compatibility with absolute paths\n\n### Usage Examples:\n```bash\n# Relative path (new feature)\ndotnet run -- video-notes --input \"Education/MBA-Resources/Course1\"\n\n# Absolute path (still works)\ndotnet run -- video-notes --input \"C:\\Users\\user\\OneDrive\\Education\\MBA-Resources\\Course1\"\n\n# With OneDrive root override\ndotnet run -- video-notes --input \"Course1\" --onedrive-fullpath-root \"C:\\CustomPath\"\n```\n\n### Testing Results:\n- ✅ Relative paths resolve correctly to absolute paths\n- ✅ Absolute paths pass through unchanged\n- ✅ Both video-notes and pdf-notes support relative paths\n- ✅ Command-line overrides work as expected\n- ✅ Proper error handling and logging\n\n### Configuration Integration:\n- Uses onedrive_fullpath_root from config.json by default\n- --onedrive-fullpath-root flag overrides config setting\n- Works with existing OneDrive vault root configuration\n\nThe implementation is complete and fully functional, significantly improving CLI usability.",
