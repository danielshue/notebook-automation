  "details": "# Logging Standardization Progress\n\nWe've been working on standardizing the logging approach in the Notebook Automation project to ensure everything uses the centralized LoggingService. Here's our current progress:\n\n## Completed\n- Identified all places where YamlHelper was directly instantiated and updated most of them\n- Updated MetadataTemplateManager to use injected IYamlHelper and modified its registration in ServiceRegistration\n- Confirmed TagProcessor has been updated to use injected IYamlHelper\n- Confirmed VideoNoteProcessor has been updated to use injected IYamlHelper\n- Verified that most manual logger creations have been removed from the production code\n\n## Pending\n- Fix VideoNoteProcessor.cs where it still creates LoggerFactory instances for CourseStructureExtractor and MetadataHierarchyDetector\n- We're seeing compiler errors when modifying VideoNoteProcessor.cs directly, possibly due to file formatting issues\n- A better approach would be to add ILoggingService parameter to VideoNoteProcessor constructor and modify all service registrations\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Update VideoNoteProcessor registration to pass in LoggingService parameter if possible\n2. Find and fix any other direct LoggerFactory creations in PdfNoteProcessor or other processors\n3. Run a full build with tests to ensure all logging is working correctly\n4. Update documentation to emphasize using LoggingService for all logging needs\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- The LoggingService is registered as a singleton\n- All loggers should be obtained via LoggingService.GetLogger<T>()\n- Test classes can continue to use direct LoggerFactory instantiations\n- YamlHelper should always get a typed logger ILogger<YamlHelper>",
