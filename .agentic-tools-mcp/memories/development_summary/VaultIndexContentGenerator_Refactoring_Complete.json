  "title": "VaultIndexContentGenerator Refactoring Complete",
  "details": "Successfully refactored VaultIndexContentGenerator.GetRootIndexFilename method to remove caching and implement relative path calculation.\n\nSUMMARY OF CHANGES:\n\n1. REMOVED CACHING MECHANISM:\n   - Eliminated _cachedRootIndexFilename and _cachedVaultPath fields\n   - Removed all caching logic from the method implementation\n   - Method now calculates path fresh on each call\n\n2. IMPLEMENTED RELATIVE PATH CALCULATION:\n   - Updated method signature: GetRootIndexFilename(string vaultPath, string currentFolderPath)\n   - Added new CalculateRelativePath helper method using Uri-based path calculation\n   - Returns relative paths suitable for Obsidian [[]] wikilink syntax\n   - Handles edge cases like same folder, invalid paths with proper fallbacks\n\n3. UPDATED ALL DEPENDENCIES:\n   - Updated method call in AddNavigationSection to pass currentFolderPath\n   - Fixed test class override method signature in VaultIndexContentGeneratorTests\n   - Updated XML documentation to reflect new behavior and parameters\n\n4. MAINTAINED FUNCTIONALITY:\n   - Preserves original search strategy (prioritized filenames, template-type: main fallback)\n   - Uses _defaultVaultRootPath (notebook_vault_fullpath_root) as configured\n   - Maintains comprehensive error handling and logging\n\nBENEFITS:\n- Eliminates potential stale cache issues\n- Provides accurate relative paths for navigation links\n- Better supports dynamic vault structures\n- Maintains Obsidian wikilink compatibility\n\nAll tests pass and solution builds successfully. Changes are backward compatible for consumers.",
