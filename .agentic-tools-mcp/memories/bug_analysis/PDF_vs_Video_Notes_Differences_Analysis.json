  "title": "PDF vs Video Notes - SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED",
  "details": "## Implementation Completed: \"## Notes\" Section Fix\n\n### âœ… **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**\n\nSuccessfully refactored the \"## Notes\" section logic to be generic and consistent across all document types by pushing it down to the base `DocumentNoteProcessorBase` class.\n\n### ðŸ”§ **Changes Made:**\n\n1. **Added `EnsureNotesSection()` method to DocumentNoteProcessorBase**:\n   - Generic method that ensures any markdown note has a \"## Notes\" section at the end\n   - Used by all document processors (PDF, Video, and future types)\n\n2. **Updated DocumentNoteProcessorBase.GenerateMarkdownNote()**:\n   - Now calls `EnsureNotesSection()` before returning the final markdown\n   - Ensures consistent structure across all note types\n\n3. **Simplified VideoNoteProcessor**:\n   - Removed redundant \"## Notes\" logic since base class now handles it\n   - Fixed inconsistency where `noSummary` mode created \"## Note\" (singular) instead of \"## Notes\" (plural)\n   - Maintained the OneDrive share link functionality in the References section\n\n### ðŸ§ª **Testing Results:**\n- All 546 tests passed âœ…\n- 0 failed tests âœ…  \n- Solution builds successfully âœ…\n\n### ðŸ“‹ **Benefits:**\n- **Consistency**: Both PDF and Video notes now always include \"## Notes\" section\n- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for Notes section logic\n- **Extensibility**: Future document types automatically get Notes section\n- **User Experience**: Notes section is never modified and always available for user content\n\n### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved:**\nThe original issue where PDF notes didn't include the \"## Notes\" section while video notes did is now resolved. All generated notes will have a consistent structure with the Notes section always present at the end.",
