  "details": "## Task Completion Summary: C# Notebook Automation CLI Build Fixes\n\n### COMPLETED FIXES:\n\n#### 1. **CI Versioning Issues ‚úÖ**\n- Fixed missing `/p:InformationalVersion` in build and publish steps\n- Removed hardcoded version attributes from `AssemblyInfo.cs`\n- Set `<GenerateAssemblyInfo>true</GenerateAssemblyInfo>` in CLI csproj\n- CI now properly generates version format: `1.0.526.62+<git-hash>`\n\n#### 2. **CI Workflow Improvements ‚úÖ**\n- **Fixed YAML formatting issues** - removed missing newlines that caused build failures\n- **Moved formatting verification earlier** in workflow (fail-fast approach)\n- **Added robust versioning** with Microsoft-recommended format\n- **Improved artifact handling** with proper retention policies\n- **Code coverage** is properly configured and working\n- **Both win-x64 and win-arm64** builds are configured (though arm64 missing from latest artifact)\n\n#### 3. **Config Files Inclusion ‚úÖ**\n- **Updated CLI csproj** to include config files as content for publish\n- **Added CopyConfig MSBuild target** to copy config files to output\n- **Added Content ItemGroup** with `CopyToPublishDirectory=PreserveNewest`\n- **Verified config files are now included** in publish output (test-publish-check)\n\n#### 4. **Script Improvements ‚úÖ**\n- **Updated download-latest-artifact.ps1** with relative paths and better logging\n- **Removed obsolete Python workflow** (ci-python.yml)\n- **Enhanced error handling and logging** throughout scripts\n\n### CURRENT STATUS:\n\n#### ‚úÖ **WORKING:**\n- CI builds with correct versioning (`na.exe --version` reports proper version)\n- Code coverage collection and artifact upload\n- Config files included in CLI publish output\n- Formatting verification in CI workflow\n- Test execution and artifact upload\n- Local build and publish processes\n\n#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING INVESTIGATION:**\n- **win-arm64 missing from CI artifact** - workflow configured but artifact only contains win-x64\n- **CI artifact verification** - need to confirm next CI run includes both architectures and config files\n\n#### üìÅ **KEY FILES MODIFIED:**\n- `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml` - Fixed formatting, versioning, moved formatting check\n- `src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Cli/NotebookAutomation.Cli.csproj` - Added config content inclusion\n- `src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Cli/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` - Removed hardcoded versions\n- `scripts/download-latest-artifact.ps1` - Improved logging and paths\n\n#### üß™ **VERIFICATION COMPLETED:**\n- Local publish includes config files ‚úÖ\n- Version reporting works correctly ‚úÖ\n- CI workflow YAML is valid ‚úÖ\n- Build and test processes function ‚úÖ\n\n### NEXT STEPS:\n1. Monitor next CI run to confirm win-arm64 build presence\n2. Verify CI artifact includes config directory\n3. Test downloaded CI artifact functionality\n\nAll major issues have been resolved. The CLI build now properly includes versioning, config files, and has a robust CI process with code coverage.",
