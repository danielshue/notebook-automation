  "title": "DocumentNoteBatchProcessor Enum/Class Extraction",
  "details": "Successfully extracted enums and classes from DocumentNoteBatchProcessor.cs into separate files for better code organization.\n\nEXTRACTED FILES:\n1. DocumentProcessingStatus.cs - Enum for processing status (Waiting, Processing, Completed, Failed)\n2. ProcessingStage.cs - Enum for processing stages (NotStarted, ContentExtraction, AISummaryGeneration, MarkdownCreation, ShareLinkGeneration, Completed)\n3. QueueItem.cs - Class representing a document in the processing queue with properties for FilePath, Status, DocumentType, Stage, metadata, etc.\n4. QueueChangedEventArgs.cs - Event args for queue change notifications\n5. DocumentProcessingProgressEventArgs.cs - Event args for processing progress updates\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Created Models directory: d:\\source\\notebook-automation-csharp-migration\\src\\c-sharp\\NotebookAutomation.Core\\Models\\\n- All extracted files placed in NotebookAutomation.Core.Models namespace\n- Updated DocumentNoteBatchProcessor.cs to add using NotebookAutomation.Core.Models\n- Updated PdfNoteBatchProcessor.cs to add using NotebookAutomation.Core.Models\n- Removed original enum/class definitions from DocumentNoteBatchProcessor.cs\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Project builds successfully with only 1 unrelated warning\n- All functionality maintained - application runs correctly\n- Code is now better organized with clear separation of concerns\n- Enums and data models are in dedicated Models namespace for better maintainability\n\nThis refactoring improves code organization and follows the project's philosophy of maintainable, readable code that prioritizes clarity over cleverness.",
