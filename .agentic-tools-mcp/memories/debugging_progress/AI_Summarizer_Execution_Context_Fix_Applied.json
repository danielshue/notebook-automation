  "title": "AI Summarizer Execution Context Fix Applied",
  "details": "**✅ RESOLVED: AI Summarizer Execution Context Issue**\n\n**FINAL STATUS**: Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of different AI Summarizer results between `dotnet run` and compiled executable.\n\n**ROOT CAUSE**: Non-deterministic file enumeration order in GetMarkdownFilesRecursive() method. Directory.GetFiles() returns files in different orders depending on execution context.\n\n**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:\n1. Added deterministic sorting: `.OrderBy(f => Path.GetFileName(f), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)`\n2. Applied to both file and directory enumeration in MetadataEnsureBatchProcessor.cs\n3. Copied config folder to dist\\win-arm64 for proper configuration access\n\n**VERIFICATION CONFIRMED**:\n✅ File enumeration now IDENTICAL between execution methods\n✅ Final processing results IDENTICAL: 35 processed, 183 skipped, 218 total\n✅ First 10 files processed in same order\n✅ Same vault root and target paths used by both methods\n\n**IMPACT**: AI Summarizer now produces deterministic, consistent results regardless of how it's executed (dotnet run vs na.exe), eliminating the execution context dependency that caused different file processing orders.\n\n**LESSON LEARNED**: File system enumeration order can vary between execution contexts even with identical arguments and configuration. Always use explicit sorting for deterministic behavior in file processing applications.",
