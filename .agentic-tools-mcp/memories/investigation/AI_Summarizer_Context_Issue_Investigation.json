  "details": "Investigation of AI Summarizer execution context issue between 'dotnet run' and compiled executable:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### 1. File Discovery is NOT the Root Cause\n- Both methods discover the same total number of files (218)\n- Both process the same number of files (35 processed, 183 skipped)\n- Path resolution is identical between methods\n- File enumeration logic in MetadataEnsureBatchProcessor.cs is working consistently\n\n### 2. The Real Issue: Different File Processing Order/Selection\n- **dotnet run**: Processed file 43/218: \"Module 2 Word Transcript-Notes.md\"\n- **executable**: Processed file 49/218: \"metrics-to-assess-performance-video.md\"\n- While total counts match, the specific files being processed differ\n- This suggests different enumeration order or timing-dependent processing\n\n### 3. Output Differences\n- dotnet run: 749 bytes output (includes launch settings message)\n- executable: 593-570 bytes output (no launch settings message)\n- File size difference is partly due to launch settings message but also different progress messages\n\n### 4. Technical Analysis\n- Path resolution is identical: \"C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA\\Value Chain Management\\Operations Management\"\n- Vault root resolution is identical: \"C:\\Users\\danshue.REDMOND\\Vault\\01_Projects\\MBA\"\n- Debug logging shows same path analysis results\n- No working directory issues detected\n\n## Potential Causes:\n1. **File enumeration order**: Directory.GetFiles() might return files in different order depending on execution context\n2. **Threading/timing differences**: Different startup timing might affect which files are processed\n3. **State differences**: Some shared state or caching might behave differently\n4. **Random seeding**: If there's any randomization in processing order, it might use different seeds\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. Investigate file enumeration order consistency in GetMarkdownFilesRecursive\n2. Check if there's any randomization or non-deterministic behavior in file processing\n3. Add logging to track exact file enumeration order\n4. Verify if this is a cosmetic issue (different files processed but same overall result) or functional issue\n\n## Test Files:\n- Functional test: D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\test-results\\*functional*20250615-090357*\n- Path debug test: D:\\source\\notebook-automation\\test-results\\*path-debug*20250615-090316*",
