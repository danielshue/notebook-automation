  "title": "✅ RESOLVED: Metadata Hierarchy Field Bug Analysis",
  "details": "BUG ANALYSIS AND RESOLUTION - METADATA HIERARCHY FIELDS:\n\nPROBLEM: The ensure-metadata command was not correctly removing inappropriate hierarchy fields (program, course, class, module) from index files based on their index-type. For example, a course-level index file (like MBA.md) was retaining inappropriate \"class\" metadata fields.\n\nROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:\n1. UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy only removed fields for main-index (maxLevel=0) and only updated fields if missing/empty, not if incorrect\n2. HasMetadataChanged method in MetadataEnsureProcessor did not detect field removals as changes, so files were skipped\n3. Index type matching was inconsistent - code checked for \"course-index\" but actual values were \"course\"\n\nFIXES IMPLEMENTED:\n1. Modified UpdateMetadataWithHierarchy in MetadataHierarchyDetector.cs:\n   - Aggressively remove hierarchy fields beyond maxLevel for ANY index type\n   - Always update fields with correct values, even if non-empty\n   - Added support for both \"-index\" suffixed and plain index types (\"course-index\" and \"course\")\n\n2. Modified HasMetadataChanged in MetadataEnsureProcessor.cs:\n   - Detect removals, additions, and value changes as changes\n   - Not just additions or empty-to-value transitions\n\nVERIFICATION RESULTS:\n✅ MBA.md (course-level): Correctly has program/course, inappropriate \"class\" field removed\n✅ Digital Program.md (class-level): Correctly has program/course/class, inappropriate \"module\" field removed  \n✅ MBA-Program.md (program-level): Correctly has only program, all other fields removed\n✅ Files are now properly updated on disk when inappropriate hierarchy fields are detected\n\nSTATUS: RESOLVED - The ensure-metadata command now correctly removes inappropriate hierarchy fields based on index-type",
