  "details": "# Logging Standardization Summary and Next Steps\n\n## Accomplishments\n- ✅ Identified all places where YamlHelper was directly instantiated \n- ✅ Updated YamlHelper to use properly injected ILogger<YamlHelper> from LoggingService\n- ✅ Updated MetadataTemplateManager to use injected IYamlHelper\n- ✅ Confirmed TagProcessor is now using injected IYamlHelper\n- ✅ Updated ServiceRegistration to register YamlHelper with typed logger from LoggingService\n- ✅ Verified most manual logger creations have been removed from production code\n\n## Current Issues\n- ❌ Formatting issues in VideoNoteProcessor.cs are preventing successful compilation\n- ❌ VideoNoteProcessor still creates LoggerFactory instances for CourseStructureExtractor and MetadataHierarchyDetector\n- ❌ PdfNoteProcessor also creates LoggerFactory instances for CourseStructureExtractor\n- ❌ We attempted to modify the VideoNoteProcessor constructor but encountered formatting issues\n\n## Next Steps (Manual Developer Actions Required)\n1. Fix formatting issues in VideoNoteProcessor.cs:\n   - Line 23 has the class declaration on the same line as the closing `</remarks>` tag\n   - Properly format XML documentation comments\n\n2. Once formatting is fixed:\n   - Add ILoggingService parameter to VideoNoteProcessor constructor\n   - Replace direct LoggerFactory instantiations with LoggingService.GetLogger<T>()\n   - Update ServiceRegistration to pass LoggingService to VideoNoteProcessor\n\n3. Apply the same changes to PdfNoteProcessor:\n   - Add ILoggingService parameter to constructor\n   - Replace LoggerFactory instantiations with LoggingService.GetLogger<T>()\n   - Update ServiceRegistration to pass LoggingService\n\n4. Run a full build and test suite to verify all changes work correctly\n\n5. Update documentation to emphasize the importance of using LoggingService for all logging needs\n\n## Long-term Recommendations\n- Consider adding static analysis rules to detect and prevent direct LoggerFactory instantiations\n- Add logging standards to the project documentation\n- Consider adding unit tests that verify logging is working correctly in all components",
