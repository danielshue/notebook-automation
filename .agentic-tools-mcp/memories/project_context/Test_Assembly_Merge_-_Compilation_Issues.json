  "details": "Successfully merged NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests and NotebookAutomation.Cli.Tests into unified NotebookAutomation.Tests project.\n\nPROGRESS:\n✅ Created new test project with proper structure (Core/, Cli/ subdirectories)  \n✅ Updated namespaces from NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/Cli.Tests to NotebookAutomation.Tests.Core/Cli\n✅ Updated InternalsVisibleTo attributes in Core and CLI assemblies \n✅ Fixed CLI class access issues (all CLI classes now accessible)\n✅ Updated solution file to reference only new test project\n✅ Removed obj/bin build artifacts that caused duplicate assembly errors\n✅ Fixed all missing using statements for test doubles\n✅ Project builds successfully with only 1 warning\n✅ Tests run and generate coverage report\n\nCURRENT STATUS:\n- Tests run but coverage still only shows NotebookAutomation.Core (not CLI)\n- CLI tests run but may not exercise CLI assembly code effectively\n- Many CLI tests reference Program class and CLI commands but may only test interfaces\n- Need to verify CLI tests actually load and execute CLI assembly code\n\nANALYSIS:\n- CLI tests mostly test command parsing and help output, not actual CLI logic\n- Coverage is per-assembly loaded during test execution\n- If CLI code isn't meaningfully executed (beyond mocked interfaces), CLI assembly won't appear in coverage\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Examine what CLI tests actually do vs. what Core tests do\n2. Potentially add integration tests that load CLI assembly directly\n3. OR accept that CLI coverage is minimal since it's mostly interface/plumbing code\n4. Verify the solution architecture is now correct for collecting coverage from both assemblies when they are exercised\n\nThe merged test project architecture is correct - both assemblies are accessible and can be covered if exercised.",
