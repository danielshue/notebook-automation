  "title": "AppConfig.FindConfigFile Migration - COMPLETED",
  "details": "## AppConfig.FindConfigFile Migration Status - COMPLETED ✅\n\n### PROBLEM RESOLVED:\nConfiguration file discovery was inconsistent between ConfigManager and legacy AppConfig.FindConfigFile method, causing ARM64 builds and other deployments to fail to find config files properly.\n\n### SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. **✅ Added Modern Discovery Methods**: Created `ConfigurationSetup.DiscoverConfigurationFileAsync()` and `ConfigurationSetup.DiscoverConfigurationFile()` that use ConfigManager for consistent discovery.\n\n2. **✅ Marked Legacy Method as Obsolete**: AppConfig.FindConfigFile is now marked with [Obsolete] attribute with clear migration guidance.\n\n3. **✅ Updated Core Usage**: ConfigurationSetup.BuildConfiguration() now uses the new DiscoverConfigurationFile() method internally.\n\n4. **✅ Consistent Discovery Order**: The new methods follow the same discovery order as ConfigManager:\n   - CLI option (explicit path)\n   - Environment variable (NOTEBOOKAUTOMATION_CONFIG)\n   - Current working directory\n   - Executable directory\n   - Executable config subdirectory\n\n5. **✅ Backward Compatibility**: The new methods maintain the same API surface for easy migration.\n\n### REMAINING USAGE:\n- Only test files (AppConfigTests.cs) still use the old method - this is acceptable for testing the deprecated functionality\n- Documentation references will be updated when the method is fully removed\n\n### PROMPT TEMPLATE ISSUE ALSO RESOLVED:\n- ✅ Source prompt files (chunk_summary_prompt.md, final_summary_prompt.md) use correct variable names ({{$onedrivePath}}, {{$course}}, {{$content}})\n- ✅ AISummarizer code passes matching variable names (onedrivePath, course, content)\n- ✅ Semantic Kernel \"function identifier is empty\" error should be resolved\n\n### MIGRATION COMPLETE:\nThe configuration discovery system is now modern, consistent, and should work properly across all architectures including ARM64.",
