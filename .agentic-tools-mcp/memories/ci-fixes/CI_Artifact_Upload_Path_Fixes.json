  "details": "## CI Workflow Path Fixes - Issue Resolution\n\n### PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:\n1. **Test Results Upload**: ‚úÖ Path was correct (`src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/TestResults/*.trx`)\n2. **Coverage Results Upload**: ‚ùå Path was wrong - coverage files are in GUID subdirectories\n3. **Published Executables Upload**: ‚ùå Artifacts not found, suggesting publish issues\n\n### FIXES APPLIED:\n\n#### 1. Fixed Coverage File Path ‚úÖ\n**Before:**\n```yaml\npath: src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/TestResults/**/*.xml\n```\n\n**After:**\n```yaml\npath: src/c-sharp/NotebookAutomation.Core.Tests/TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml\n```\n\n**Reason:** Coverage files are created in random GUID directories like `888c8911-ae80-4e72-a16d-c6893ab5d249/coverage.cobertura.xml`\n\n#### 2. Publish Issues Analysis üîç\nThe error message showed:\n```\nWarning: No files were found with the provided path: publish/win-x64/\npublish/win-arm64/. No artifacts will be uploaded.\n```\n\n**Local testing confirmed publish works correctly:**\n- Config files are included ‚úÖ\n- Single-file exe is created ‚úÖ\n- Files are placed in correct publish/ directories ‚úÖ\n\n**Possible CI Issues:**\n- Build failures before publish steps\n- Path resolution differences in CI environment\n- Missing dependencies for arm64 builds\n\n### CURRENT STATUS:\n- **‚úÖ Test results** should upload correctly \n- **‚úÖ Coverage results** should upload correctly (path fixed)\n- **‚ö†Ô∏è Published executables** - need to monitor next CI run for build failures\n\n### NEXT STEPS:\n1. Monitor next CI run for successful artifact uploads\n2. If publish issues persist, check for build failures in publish steps\n3. Verify arm64 builds complete successfully in CI environment\n\n### VERIFICATION:\n- Local test run created files in expected locations\n- Coverage path fix targets the specific file pattern `**/coverage.cobertura.xml`\n- Test results path was already correct",
