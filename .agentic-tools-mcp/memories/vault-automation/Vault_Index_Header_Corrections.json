  "details": "The VaultIndexProcessor header issue has been identified:\n\nACTUAL PROBLEM:\n- The MBA.md file (main index) is not being regenerated by the current command\n- Only subfolder indexes are being processed: Digital Program, Value Program, XYZ Program\n- These subfolders are correctly identified as hierarchy level 1 but they get template-type \"main\" in debug logs\n- The main index (MBA.md) still shows \"## Courses\" instead of \"## Programs\"\n\nROOT CAUSE:\n- The vault root folder (MBA) processing might follow a different code path\n- The current command processes subfolders but not the root index file\n- There may be separate logic for vault root vs subfolder index generation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Fixed course level (hierarchy 2) to show \"## Modules\" instead of \"## Classes\" ✓\n- Fixed spacing issues in Bases integration ✓\n- BUT the main index header fix needs different approach\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Find where vault root index generation happens\n2. Fix the main index header logic\n3. Verify that \"MBA.md\" gets regenerated with \"## Programs\"",
