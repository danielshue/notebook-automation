Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions\n2. Monitor the workflow run to verify fixes\n3. The VS Code YAML warnings about env context are false positives\n\nThe main issues were nullable reference types and workflow structure, not fundamental build problems. The local CI build now passes completely.",
