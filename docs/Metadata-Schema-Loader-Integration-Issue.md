# Metadata Schema Loader and Reserved Tag Logic Integration Issue

**Issue Type:** Epic/Feature Integration  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending  
**Created:** 2025-01-12  
**Estimated Effort:** 26-41 days  
**Estimated Cost:** $31,120-$57,040  

## Executive Summary

This issue tracks the comprehensive integration of the unified metadata schema loader and reserved tag logic for Notebook Automation. This initiative replaces legacy approaches, improves data integrity, and enables future growth through plugin-based extensibility.

**Key Objectives:**
- Implement unified, extensible metadata schema loader
- Integrate reserved tag logic across all components
- Enable plugin-based extensibility via registry pattern
- Migrate from legacy `metadata.yaml` to modern `.yml` schema
- Ensure seamless operation across Core C#, CLI, and Obsidian plugin components

**Success Metrics:**
- All metadata operations use the new schema loader and registry pattern
- Reserved tags and universal fields are present and validated in all outputs
- Legacy `metadata.yaml` fully deprecated and replaced
- Plugin system enables runtime extension without codebase changes
