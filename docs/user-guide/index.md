# User Guide

Comprehensive guide for using Notebook Automation in various scenarios and workflows.

## Overview

This user guide covers advanced usage scenarios, workflow optimization, and best practices for getting the most out of Notebook Automation. Whether you're processing academic notebooks, technical documentation, or research materials, this guide will help you work efficiently.

## What You'll Learn

- **Advanced Processing Techniques** - Handle complex document structures and batch operations
- **Workflow Integration** - Incorporate notebook automation into your existing processes
- **Output Customization** - Tailor metadata extraction and summary generation
- **Performance Optimization** - Process large document collections efficiently
- **Quality Control** - Ensure consistent and accurate results

## Quick Navigation

### Document Processing

- [File Processing](file-processing.md) - Handle different file types and structures
- [Batch Operations](batch-operations.md) - Process multiple files and directories
- [Output Management](output-management.md) - Organize and customize output

### Workflow Integration

- [Academic Workflows](academic-workflows.md) - Course notes, research, and study materials
- [CI/CD Integration](ci-cd-integration.md) - Automate documentation processing
- [Scripting and Automation](scripting-automation.md) - Custom scripts and workflows

### Advanced Features

- [Custom Templates](custom-templates.md) - Customize metadata extraction and summaries
- [Performance Tuning](performance-tuning.md) - Optimize for speed and resource usage
- [Quality Assurance](quality-assurance.md) - Validate and verify processing results

## Getting Started with Advanced Usage

If you're new to Notebook Automation, start with our [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/index.md). For basic commands and configuration, see:

- [Basic Commands](../getting-started/basic-commands.md)
- [Configuration Guide](../configuration/index.md)

## Common Use Cases

### Academic Research

Process research papers, lecture notes, and study materials with specialized academic templates and metadata extraction.

```powershell
.\na.exe process "research-papers/" --config "academic-config.json" --recursive
```

### Documentation Management

Automate processing of technical documentation, API docs, and knowledge bases.

```powershell
.\na.exe process "docs/" --output "processed-docs/" --template "technical-summary"
```

### Content Analysis

Extract insights and metadata from large collections of documents for analysis and organization.

```powershell
.\na.exe process "content-library/" --recursive --output "analysis/" --verbose
```

## Best Practices

### Organization

- Use consistent directory structures
- Implement naming conventions for output files
- Version control your configuration files

### Performance

- Process files in batches for large collections
- Configure appropriate rate limits for AI services
- Monitor resource usage during processing

### Quality

- Validate configuration before large operations
- Review sample outputs before batch processing
- Implement quality checks for critical workflows

## Support and Resources
