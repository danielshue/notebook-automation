# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are no longer actively used in the MBA Notebook Automation system. They have been moved here to keep the main directory clean while preserving the code for reference.

## Contents

- **add_nested_tags_fixed.py** - Intermediate fixed version of the tag processor
- **add_nested_tags_updated.py** - Updated version of the tag processor
- **generate_tag_doc.py** - Original version of tag document generator

## Why Archived?

These scripts have been superseded by newer, more comprehensive versions or their functionality has been integrated into the tools package. They are kept for reference in case functionality needs to be recovered or compared.

## Using Archived Code

If you need functionality from these scripts, prefer to look at the current versions in the main directory or integrate the required functionality rather than using these archived scripts directly.
