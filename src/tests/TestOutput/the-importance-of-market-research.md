# Video Note

The text emphasizes the importance of market research in the business world. It reduces uncertainty and the likelihood of product failure by providing accurate and timely information about the market and potential customers. The text uses Netflix as an example of a company that effectively utilizes market research. Netflix collects extensive data on user behavior, such as what, when, and how they watch content, and uses this data to recommend shows, decide what original content to produce, and communicate with users based on their preferences. The text also discusses the benefits of market research, including the ability to investigate expansion opportunities, understand customers and competitors, and develop effective marketing strategies. The example of Casio Europe is given, which uses consumer feedback surveys to gain insights into its target group and adjust its communication tactics accordingly.
