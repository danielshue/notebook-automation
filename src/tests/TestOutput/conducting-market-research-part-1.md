# Video Note

The first step in conducting marketing research is to identify the information needed and the type of research to be conducted, which is often determined by the available funds. The research problem must be identified, such as a shrinking market or a product line that isn't selling. The next step is to determine if the necessary information already exists. If it does, secondary research methods can be used. If not, primary research must be conducted. Primary research is customized to your needs and can involve experimental research, controlled store testing, focus groups, or survey research. However, it can be more time-consuming and costly. When conducting survey research, hypotheses must be developed, the population to be sampled must be decided, and the data collection instrument must be chosen. The survey should be kept to 11-15 questions to maintain quality responses and should take no longer than 7-8 minutes to complete. When developing the survey, consider if the question is necessary, if the respondent has the necessary information, and if sensitive questions are absolutely necessary. The types of questions used can be open-ended or closed-ended, with the latter often being preferred for its ease of data analysis.
