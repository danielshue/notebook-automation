# Video Note

The text is a transcript of a lecture on conducting market research, specifically focusing on designing a survey. The speaker emphasizes the importance of using simple, clear language in survey questions to avoid confusion and bias. Ambiguous words and phrases, such as "often" or "regularly", should be avoided, as should leading questions that manipulate respondents into answering a certain way. The speaker also advises against using double-barreled questions, which ask about two separate issues but only allow for one answer. Instead, these should be split into two separate questions. The sequence of questions should start with general ones and gradually become more specific, using a funnel approach. The design of the questionnaire should be uncluttered, concise, and include graphics if necessary. The speaker also suggests pretesting the survey with a small sample group to identify any potential issues. The final step is to revise the questionnaire based on the pretest feedback before administering it to the target group.
