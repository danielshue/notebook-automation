## Executive Summary

This epic tracks the comprehensive integration of the unified metadata schema loader and reserved tag logic for Notebook Automation. This initiative replaces legacy approaches, improves data integrity, and enables future growth through plugin-based extensibility.

**Key Objectives:**
- Implement unified, extensible metadata schema loader
- Integrate reserved tag logic across all components  
- Enable plugin-based extensibility via registry pattern
- Migrate from legacy `metadata.yaml` to modern `.yml` schema
- Ensure seamless operation across Core C#, CLI, and Obsidian plugin components

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] All metadata operations use the new MetadataSchemaLoader
- [ ] Reserved tags and universal fields are present and validated in all outputs
- [ ] FieldValueResolverRegistry enables dynamic registration of resolvers
- [ ] Plugins can register new resolvers at runtime without codebase changes
- [ ] Legacy `metadata.yaml` is fully deprecated and replaced with `.yml` schema

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] MetadataTemplateManager, MetadataHierarchyDetector, YamlHelper updated for schema loader
- [ ] All CLI command classes use schema loader for validation and generation
- [ ] All processors use registry-based resolver pattern
- [ ] Schema files bundled correctly, deployment scripts updated
- [ ] Comprehensive tests for all new functionality and migration scenarios

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All existing and new test suites execute successfully
- [ ] Migration guide, API docs, and user documentation published
- [ ] No regression in processing performance
- [ ] Reserved tag logic prevents accidental overrides

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus Area |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Phase 1: Design & Planning** | 2-4 days | Architecture docs, API designs, migration strategy |
| **Phase 2: Registry Implementation** | 4-6 days | Core registry, resolver abstractions, schema loader |
| **Phase 3: Specialized Resolvers** | 5-8 days | File-type specific resolvers, context handling |
| **Phase 4: CLI/Processor Refactor** | 5-7 days | Updated CLI commands, processor integration |
| **Phase 5: Plugin Integration** | 3-5 days | Plugin system, runtime registration, build updates |
| **Phase 6: Migration & Docs** | 3-5 days | Migration tools, comprehensive documentation |
| **Phase 7: Testing & Review** | 4-6 days | Complete test suite, final review, release prep |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 26-41 days  
**Total Estimated Cost**: $31,120-$57,040

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Migration complexity | High | Comprehensive migration guide, automated scripts, fallback options |
| Breaking changes affecting users | Medium | Early communication, detailed documentation, staged rollout |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Clear ownership assignment, progress monitoring, escalation procedures |
| Plugin compatibility issues | Medium | Early testing, clear extension API, community feedback |
| Documentation gaps | Medium | Prioritize documentation, assign dedicated leads, pre-release reviews |

## Team Assignments

| Component Area | Owner/Team | Key Responsibilities |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Schema Loader & Registry | Core C# Team | Registry implementation, resolver abstractions, schema validation |
| CLI Integration | CLI Team | Command refactoring, metadata validation, reserved tag enforcement |
| Plugin System | Plugin Team | Extension points, runtime registration, plugin compatibility |
| Migration & Documentation | Migration/Docs Team | User guides, migration scripts, API documentation |
| Testing & Validation | QA Team | Comprehensive test coverage, integration testing, migration validation |

## Child Issues

The following child issues will be created to track specific implementation areas:

- [ ] #[TBD] - Resolver Abstraction & Implementation
- [ ] #[TBD] - Core C# Components Integration  
- [ ] #[TBD] - CLI Commands Integration
- [ ] #[TBD] - Plugin System & Build Integration
- [ ] #[TBD] - Migration & Documentation
- [ ] #[TBD] - Testing & Validation

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Architecture review and approval
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmation
- [ ] Development environment setup

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] External library dependencies
- [ ] Parallel feature development coordination
- [ ] Performance benchmark requirements

## Success Metrics

- **Extensibility**: Enable dynamic addition of new file types via plugin system
- **Maintainability**: Centralized schema logic reduces duplication and errors  
- **Developer Experience**: Improved testing, dependency injection, and documentation
- **Future Growth**: Foundation for community contributions and third-party extensions

## Communication Plan

- **Weekly Progress Updates**: Status updates via project channels
- **Pre-Implementation**: Stakeholder notification and technical review
- **During Implementation**: Regular sync meetings and blocker escalation
- **Post-Implementation**: Migration support and performance monitoring
