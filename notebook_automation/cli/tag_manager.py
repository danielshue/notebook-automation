CLI for advanced tag management operations in markdown files within a directory.

This tool is designed as a flexible entry point for complex or custom tag-related workflows that go beyond simple tag addition, cleaning, or restructuring. It is intended for power users and maintainers who need to:

- Perform bulk tag refactoring, renaming, or migration across many notes
- Analyze tag usage patterns and generate tag statistics or reports
- Validate tag hierarchies and detect inconsistencies or orphaned tags
- Apply custom tag transformations or enforce project-specific tag policies
- Integrate with other notebook automation tools for advanced metadata management

The script is program-agnostic and can be extended to support any tag management logic required by your workflow. By default, it prints a message indicating where tag management operations would be performed. To implement custom logic, extend the `tag_manager` function.

Example usage:
    $ notebook-tag-manager <directory>
    $ notebook-tag-manager /path/to/notes --analyze --report tag-usage.md
    $ notebook-tag-manager . --refactor --old-tag "old/category" --new-tag "new/category"
