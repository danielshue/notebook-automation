# Time Value of Money - Lecture Notes

## Introduction

Money has time value because of:

1. Opportunity cost
2. Inflation
3. Risk

## Present Value Formula

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:

- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value
- r = Discount rate
- n = Number of periods

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Cash Flow

What is the present value of $1,000 received in 3 years at 8% discount rate?

PV = $1,000 / (1.08)^3 = $793.83

### Example 2: Annuity

Present value of $500 per year for 5 years at 10% discount rate.

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate PV of $5,000 in 2 years at 6%
2. Find FV of $2,000 invested for 4 years at 9%
