## Week 2 Focus: Investment Analysis

### NPV and IRR Methods

Learn to evaluate investment projects using:

- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Payback period
- Profitability index

ABC Corp is considering a $2M expansion:

- Initial investment: $2,000,000
- Annual cash flows: $500,000 for 6 years
- Required rate of return: 12%

#### NPV Calculation

NPV = -$2,000,000 + $500,000 Ã— PVIFA(12%, 6 years)

### Decision Criteria

- Accept if NPV > 0
- Accept if IRR > required rate
- Consider mutually exclusive projects
