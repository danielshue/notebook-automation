# Metadata Schema Integration Tasks

## Integration Task List

### Resolver Abstraction & Implementation

- Refactor all processors (Video, PDF, Markdown, Resource, Tag) to use the FieldValueResolverRegistry for field value resolution and metadata extraction.
- Implement specialized resolvers for each file type, following the IFileTypeMetadataResolver interface and documenting required context.
- Update the registry to support dynamic registration (including plugin DLLs) and runtime extension.
- Use constructor injection for registry and resolver dependencies in all processors for testability and extensibility.
- Document resolver usage and required context in code and integration docs for maintainability.
- Refactor batch processor logic to support composition of multiple resolvers.
- Implement runtime registry extension for plugin DLLs.
- Document required/optional resolvers for each processor in code and integration docs.
- Add integration tests for registry extension and resolver composition.
- Update build scripts to bundle plugin resolvers and registry extensions.
- Update deployment scripts to include schema and resolver DLLs.
- Add CI checks for resolver registration and schema validation.
- [ ] Implement MarkdownMetadataResolver with full extraction logic and context documentation
- [ ] Implement ResourceMetadataResolver with full extraction logic and context documentation

- Deprecate/remove references to metadata.yaml throughout the codebase and documentation.
