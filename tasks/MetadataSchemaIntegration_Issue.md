# Metadata Schema Integration Issue

## Executive Summary

This initiative delivers a unified, extensible metadata schema loader and reserved tag logic for Notebook Automation. It replaces legacy approaches, improves data integrity, and enables future growth through plugin-based extensibility. Success will be measured by seamless migration, robust validation, and improved developer experience.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Migration complexity | High | Provide migration guide, automated scripts, and fallback options |
| Breaking changes | Medium | Communicate early, document changes, offer support during rollout |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Assign clear ownership, monitor progress, escalate blockers |
| Plugin compatibility | Medium | Early testing, clear extension points, community feedback |
| Documentation gaps | Medium | Prioritize docs, assign doc leads, review before release |

## Stakeholder & Team Assignments

| Area | Owner/Team |
|------|------------|
| Schema Loader & Registry | Core C# Team |
| CLI Refactor | CLI Team |
| Plugin Integration | Plugin Team |
| Migration & Docs | Migration/Docs Team |
| Testing | QA Team |

## Milestones & Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Design & Planning | July 15 | None |
| Registry Implementation | July 22 | Design |
| Specialized Resolvers | July 30 | Registry |
| CLI/Processor Refactor | Aug 7 | Resolvers |
| Plugin Integration | Aug 14 | CLI/Processors |
| Migration & Docs | Aug 21 | All above |
| Final Testing & Review | Aug 28 | Migration/Docs |

## Acceptance Criteria & Review Process

- All metadata operations use the new schema loader and registry
- Reserved tags/universal fields present and validated in outputs
- Plugins register new resolvers at runtime
- Legacy `metadata.yaml` fully deprecated
- Migration guide and docs published
- All tests pass
- Review by leads and sign-off before release

## Change Management & Communication Plan

- Communicate changes via project updates, team meetings, and documentation
- Provide migration guide and training for affected teams
- Announce breaking changes and support channels
- Update user and developer documentation before rollout

## Open Questions & Decision Log

- [x] Finalize plugin extension API details
- [x] Confirm migration script requirements
- [x] Assign documentation leads
- [x] Review and approve timeline with stakeholders

## Cost & Effort Summary (Management Overview)

This initiative is a major release requiring significant cross-team effort and budget commitment:

- **Estimated Duration:** 26–41 days (full-time developer, plus management/coordination)
- **Estimated Cost:** $31,120–$57,040 (includes developer and management team costs)
- **Team Commitment:** Core C# team, CLI, Plugin, Migration/Docs, QA, and management oversight

Management should expect active involvement for planning, review, and coordination throughout the project lifecycle.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This PRD defines the product goals, user needs, requirements, and success criteria for the Metadata Schema Loader & Reserved Tag Integration. This upgrade is a major release that replaces legacy metadata management with a unified, extensible, and schema-driven approach, supporting future growth and plugin-based extensibility.

## Business Purpose & Release Context

This major release introduces a unified metadata schema loader, registry, and reserved tag logic, replacing legacy approaches and enabling extensible, schema-driven metadata management across the application. The refactor centralizes field and tag logic, supports plugin-based extensibility, and enforces consistent validation for all note, resource, and CLI operations. This upgrade is critical for:

- **Scalability:** Supports future growth and new file types via registry and plugin system.
- **Maintainability:** Reduces duplication, streamlines updates, and improves developer onboarding.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforces schema rules and reserved tags, preventing accidental overrides and inconsistencies.
- **Automation:** Enables robust automation and reporting by ensuring all metadata is schema-compliant.
- **Migration:** Smoothly transitions from legacy `metadata.yaml` to modern `.yml` schema, with clear deprecation and upgrade steps.

**Release Type:** Major release — introduces breaking changes, requires migration, and impacts all core, CLI, and plugin components.

## Business Goals

- Centralize metadata schema management for all note, resource, and CLI operations
- Enable extensibility via registry and plugin system for new file types and metadata extraction logic
- Enforce reserved tag and universal field logic for data integrity and automation
- Streamline migration from legacy `metadata.yaml` to modern `.yml` schema

## User Needs

- Developers need a consistent, schema-driven way to manage metadata across all components
- Plugin authors need a registry system to add new resolvers and extend metadata extraction logic
- CLI users need reliable, validated metadata outputs with reserved tags enforced
- Administrators need a clear migration path and documentation for upgrading schema files

## Product Requirements

1. The system must support a unified metadata schema file (`metadata-schema.yml`) for all metadata operations
2. Reserved tags and universal fields must be enforced and validated in all outputs
3. Registry pattern must allow dynamic registration and runtime extension of resolvers, including plugin DLLs
4. All core managers, CLI commands, note/vault processors, and plugins must use the schema loader for validation and generation
5. Migration tools and documentation must be provided for transitioning from `metadata.yaml` to `.yml`
6. Build and deployment scripts must bundle the schema file and all required resolvers
7. Comprehensive test coverage must validate reserved tag logic, schema loading, registry extension, and migration

## Success Criteria

- All metadata operations use the new schema loader and registry pattern
- Reserved tags and universal fields are present and validated in all outputs
- Plugins can register new resolvers at runtime without codebase changes
- Legacy `metadata.yaml` is fully deprecated and replaced by `.yml` schema
- Migration documentation and tools are available and verified
- All tests pass for schema, registry, resolver, and migration logic
