# PowerShell script to download the latest notebook-automation artifact from GitHub Actions
# Requires GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/) and authentication (gh auth login)
# Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with PowerShell (pwsh) installed
#
# Examples:
#   .\download-latest-artifact.ps1                              # Download complete plugin package
#   pwsh .\download-latest-artifact.ps1 -ListOnly               # List available artifacts without downloading
#   pwsh .\download-latest-artifact.ps1 -Version "1.0.1"        # Download specific version (SemVer)
#
# Parameters:
#   -Workflow: GitHub Actions workflow file name (default: ci-cross-platform.yml)
#   -Version: Specific SemVer to download (optional, downloads latest if not specified)
#   -ListOnly: Only list available artifacts without downloading
#
# Note: Downloads the complete notebook-automation package to ../dist/notebook-automation/
#       This includes the Obsidian plugin files (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css) and 
#       all platform executables (na-win-x64.exe, na-macos-arm64, na-linux-x64, etc.)
#       Ready for direct installation into Obsidian plugins folder.
